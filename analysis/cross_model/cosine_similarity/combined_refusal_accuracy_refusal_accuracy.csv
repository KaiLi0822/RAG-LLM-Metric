train_0,Why do I have to apply the parking brake fully for parking?,"[' PARKING BRAKE Before exiting the vehicle, make sure that the parking brake is fully applied.  Also, be certain to leave an automatic transmission in PARK, or manual transmission in REVERSE or FIRST gear.  The parking brake lever is located in the center console.  To apply the parking brake, pull the lever up as firmly as possible.  To release the parking brake, pull the lever up slightly, push the center button, then lower the lever completely.  When the parking brake is applied with the ignition switch ON, the Brake Warning Light in the instrument cluster will illuminate.  When parking on a hill, it is important to turn the front wheels toward the curb on a downhill grade and away from the curb on an uphill grade.  For vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission, apply the parking brake before placing the gear selector in PARK, otherwise the load on the transmission locking mechanism may make it difficult to move the gear selector out of PARK.  Note: When the parking brake is applied and the automatic transmission is placed in gear, the Brake Warning Light will flash.  If vehicle speed is detected, a chime will sound to alert the driver.  Fully release the parking brake before attempting to move the vehicle.  This light only shows that the parking brake is applied.  It does not show the degree of brake application.  WARNING: Never use the PARK position on an automatic transmission as a substitute for the parking brake.  Always apply the parking brake fully when parked to guard against vehicle movement and possible injury or damage.  When exiting the vehicle, always remove the key fob from the vehicle and lock your vehicle.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.  Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the gear selector.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle, or in a location accessible to children.  A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle.  Be sure the parking brake is fully disengaged before driving; failure to do so can lead to brake failure and a collision.  Always fully apply the parking brake when leaving your vehicle or it may roll and cause damage or injury.  Also, be certain to leave an automatic transmission in PARK, a manual transmission in REVERSE or FIRST gear.  Failure to do so may cause the vehicle to roll and cause damage or injury.  CAUTION: If the Brake Warning Light remains on with the parking brake released, a brake system malfunction is indicated.  Have the brake system serviced by an authorized dealer immediately.'
 ' Never use the PARK position as a substitute for the parking brake.  Always apply the parking brake fully when exiting the vehicle to guard against vehicle movement and possible injury or damage.  Your vehicle could move and injure you and others if it is not in PARK.  Check by trying to move the transmission gear selector out of PARK with the brake pedal released.  Make sure the transmission is in PARK before exiting the vehicle.  The transmission may not engage PARK if the vehicle is moving.  Always bring the vehicle to a complete stop before shifting to PARK, and verify that the transmission gear position indicator solidly indicates PARK (P) without blinking.  Ensure that the vehicle is completely stopped, and the PARK position is properly indicated, before exiting the vehicle.  It is dangerous to shift out of PARK or NEUTRAL if the engine speed is higher than idle speed.  If your foot is not firmly pressing the brake pedal, the vehicle could accelerate quickly forward or in reverse.  You could lose control of the vehicle and hit someone or something.  Only shift into gear when the engine is idling normally and your foot is firmly pressing the brake pedal.  Unintended movement of a vehicle could injure those in or near the vehicle.  As with all vehicles, you should never exit a vehicle while the engine is running.  Before exiting a vehicle, always come to a complete stop, then apply the parking brake, shift the transmission into PARK, and turn the ignition OFF.  When the ignition is in the OFF position, the transmission is locked in PARK, securing the vehicle against unwanted movement.  When exiting the vehicle, always make sure the ignition is in the OFF position, remove the key fob from the vehicle, and lock the vehicle.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.  Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the transmission gear selector.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle (or in a location accessible to children), and do not leave the ignition in the ACC or ON/RUN position.  A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle.  Always do a visual check that your vehicle is in park by looking for the “p” in the instrument cluster display and on the gear selector.  As an added precaution, always apply the parking brake when exiting the vehicle.  Check engine oil level.  Check windshield washer fluid level.  Check the tire pressures and look for unusual wear or damage, rotate at the first sign of irregular wear.  Check the fluid levels of the coolant reservoir, brake master cylinder, and power steering, and fill as needed.  Check function of all interior and exterior lights.'

The parking brake lever is located in the center console.  To apply the parking brake, pull the lever up as firmly as possible.  To release the parking brake, pull the lever up slightly, push the center button, then lower the lever completely.  This warning light monitors various brake functions, including brake fluid level and parking brake application.  If the brake light turns on it may indicate that the parking brake is applied, that the brake fluid level is low, or that there is a problem with the Anti-Lock Brake System reservoir.  If the Brake Warning Light remains on with the parking brake released, a brake system malfunction is indicated.  Have the brake system serviced by an authorized dealer immediately.  The light also will turn on when the parking brake is applied with the ignition switch in the ON/RUN position.']","Based on the provided context, there are a few key reasons why you should fully apply the parking brake when parking your vehicle:

Be careful of murky or muddy waters; check for hidden obstacles.  Make sure you will not be intruding on any wildlife, and you can recover the vehicle if necessary.  The key to a safe crossing is the water depth, current and bottom conditions.  On soft bottoms, the vehicle will sink in, effectively increasing the water level on the vehicle.  Be sure to consider this when determining the depth and the ability to safely cross.'
 "" Extreme care should be taken crossing any type of water.  Water crossings should be avoided, if possible, and only be attempted when necessary in a safe, responsible manner.  You should only drive through areas which are designated and approved.  You should tread lightly and avoid damage to the environment.  You should know your vehicle's abilities and be able to recover it if something goes wrong.  You should never stop or shut a vehicle off when crossing deep water unless you ingested water into the engine air intake.  If the engine stalls, do not attempt to restart it.  Determine if it has ingested water first.  The key to any crossing is low and slow.  Shift into FIRST gear (manual transmission), or DRIVE (automatic transmission), with the transfer case in the 4L position and proceed very slowly with a constant slow speed (3 to 5 mph {5 to 8 km/h} maximum) and light throttle.  Keep the vehicle moving; do not try to accelerate through the crossing.  After crossing any water higher than the bottom of the axle differentials, you should inspect all of the vehicle fluids for signs of water ingestion.  Water ingestion into the axles, transmission, transfer case, engine or vehicle interior can occur if you drive too fast or through too deep of water.  Water can cause permanent damage to engine, driveline or other vehicle components, and your brakes will be less effective once wet and/or muddy.

Even in very shallow water, a high current can still wash the dirt out from around your tires putting you and your vehicle in jeopardy.  There is still a high risk of personal injury and vehicle damage with slower water currents in depths greater than the vehicle's running ground clearance.  You should never attempt to cross flowing water which is deeper than the vehicle's running ground clearance.  Even the slowest current can push the heaviest vehicle downstream and out of control if the water is deep enough to push on the large surface area of the vehicle's body.  Before you proceed, determine the speed of the current, the water's depth, approach angle, bottom condition and if there are any obstacles.

Be sure to consider this when determining the depth and the ability to safely cross.'
 "" Extreme care should be taken crossing any type of water.  Water crossings should be avoided, if possible, and only be attempted when necessary in a safe, responsible manner.  You should only drive through areas which are designated and approved.  You should tread lightly and avoid damage to the environment.  You should know your vehicle's abilities and be able to recover it if something goes wrong.  You should never stop or shut a vehicle off when crossing deep water unless you ingested water into the engine air intake.  If the engine stalls, do not attempt to restart it.  Determine if it has ingested water first.  The key to any crossing is low and slow.  Shift into FIRST gear (manual transmission), or DRIVE (automatic transmission), with the transfer case in the 4L position and proceed very slowly with a constant slow speed (3 to 5 mph {5 to 8 km/h} maximum) and light throttle.  Keep the vehicle moving; do not try to accelerate through the crossing.  After crossing any water higher than the bottom of the axle differentials, you should inspect all of the vehicle fluids for signs of water ingestion.  Water ingestion into the axles, transmission, transfer case, engine or vehicle interior can occur if you drive too fast or through too deep of water.  Water can cause permanent damage to engine, driveline or other vehicle components, and your brakes will be less effective once wet and/or muddy.  When driving through water, do not exceed 5 mph (8 km/h).  Always check water depth before entering as a precaution, and check all fluids afterward.

This is normal operation.  The DEF pump will run for a period of time after engine shutdown to purge the DEF system.  This is normal operation and may be audible from the rear of the vehicle.'
 ' DEF Fill Procedure Remove cap from DEF fill inlet (located in fuel door).  Fuel and diesel exhaust fluid fill location 1 — diesel fuel filler 2 — diesel exhaust fluid filler insert def fill adapter/nozzle into def fill inlet.  Note: the def gauge may take up to five seconds to update after adding a gallon or more of diesel exhaust fluid (def) to the def tank.  If you have a fault related to the DEF system, the gauge may not update to the new level.  See an authorized dealer for service.  The DEF gauge may also not immediately update after a refill if the temperature of the DEF fluid is below 12°F (-11°C).  The DEF line heater will possibly warm up the DEF fluid and allow the gauge to update after a period of run time.  Under very cold conditions, it is possible that the gauge may not reflect the new fill level for several drives.  Excessive overfilling of the DEF tank can result in a MIL lamp/fault code and inaccurate level readings.  Refilling with nozzles you can fill up at any def distributor.  Proceed as follows: insert the def nozzle in the filler, start refilling and stop refilling at the first shut-off (the shut-off indicates that the def tank is full).  Do not proceed with the refilling, to prevent spillage of DEF.  Extract the nozzle.  Refilling with containers proceed as follows: check the expiration date.  Read the advice for use on the label before pouring the content of the bottle into the DEF tank.  If systems which cannot be screwed in (e.g.  Tanks) are used for refilling, after the indication appears on the instrument panel display ""⇨instrument cluster display"" fill the def tank with no more than 2 gal (8 l).  If containers which can be screwed to the filler are used, the reservoir is full when the DEF level in the container stops pouring out.  Do not proceed further.  Caution: to avoid def spillage, and possible damage to the def tank from overfilling, do not “top off” the def tank after filling.  DO NOT OVERFILL.  DEF will freeze below 12ºF (-11ºC).  The DEF system is designed to work in temperatures below the DEF freezing point, however, if the tank is overfilled and freezes, the system could be damaged.  When DEF is spilled, clean the area immediately with water and use an absorbent material to soak up the spills on the ground.  Do not attempt to start your engine if DEF is accidentally added to the diesel fuel tank as it can result in severe damage to your engine, including but not limited to failure of the fuel pump and injectors.  Never add anything other than DEF to the tank – especially any form of hydrocarbon such as diesel fuel, fuel system additives, gasoline, or any other petroleum-based product.  Even a very small amount of these, less than 100 parts per million or less than 1 oz.  per 78 gal (295 L) will contaminate the entire DEF system and will require replacement.  If owners use a container, funnel or nozzle when refilling the tank, it should either be new or one that has only been used for adding DEF.  Mopar® provides an attachable nozzle with its DEF for this purpose.  Stop filling the DEF tank immediately when any of the following happen: DEF stops flowing from the fill bottle into the DEF fill inlet, DEF splashes out the fill inlet, or a DEF pump nozzle automatically shuts off.

train_38,Any hints for using voice commands?,"[' Helpful hints for using Voice Recognition: Voice commands can be used to operate the Uconnect Phone and to navigate its menu structure.  Voice commands are required after most Uconnect Phone prompts.  There are two general methods for how Voice Command works: Prior to giving a voice command, one must wait for the beep, which follows the “Listen” prompt or another prompt.  For certain operations, compound commands can be used.  For example, instead of saying “Call” and then “John Smith” and then “mobile”, the following compound command can be said: “Call John Smith mobile.” For each feature explanation in this section, only the compound command form of the voice command is given.  You can also break the commands into parts and say each part of the command when you are asked for it.  For example, you can use the compound command form voice command “Search for John Smith,” or you can break the compound command form into two voice commands: “Search Contacts” and when asked, “John Smith.” Please remember, the Uconnect Phone works best when you talk in a normal conversational tone, as if speaking to someone sitting a few feet/meters away from you.  The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system.  The button on your steering wheel is also used to access the Voice Commands for the Uconnect Voice Command features if your vehicle is equipped.

Wind noise and passenger conversations are examples of noise that may impact recognition.  Speak clearly at a normal pace and volume while facing straight ahead.  Each time you give a Voice Command, first push the VR button, wait until after the beep, then say your Voice Command.  You can interrupt the help message or system prompts by pushing the VR button and saying a Voice Command from the current category.  “ cancel ” to stop a current voice session.  “ help ” to hear a list of suggested voice commands.  “ repeat ” to listen to the system prompts again.'

For example, instead of saying “Call” and then “John Smith” and then “mobile”, the following compound command can be said: “Call John Smith mobile.” For each feature explanation in this section, only the compound command form of the voice command is given.  You can also break the commands into parts and say each part of the command when you are asked for it.  For example, you can use the compound command form voice command “Search for John Smith,” or you can break the compound command form into two voice commands: “Search Contacts” and when asked, “John Smith.” Please remember, the Uconnect Phone works best when you talk in a normal conversational tone, as if speaking to someone sitting a few feet/meters away from you.  The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system.  The button on your steering wheel is also used to access the Voice Commands for the Uconnect Voice Command features if your vehicle is equipped.  Did you know: at any time, if you are not sure of what to say or want to learn a voice command, push the vr button and say “ help ”.  The system provides you with a list of commands.  Did you know: voice command for climate may only be used to adjust the interior temperature of your vehicle.  Voice Command will not work to adjust the heated seats or steering wheel if equipped.  The Voice Command button on your steering wheel is only used for “barge in” and when you are already in a call or want to make another call.  Reduce background noise.  Wind noise and passenger conversations are examples of noise that may impact recognition.  Speak clearly at a normal pace and volume while facing straight ahead.  Each time you give a Voice Command, first push the VR button, wait until after the beep, then say your Voice Command.  You can interrupt the help message or system prompts by pushing the VR button and saying a Voice Command from the current category.  “ cancel ” to stop a current voice session.  “ help ” to hear a list of suggested voice commands.  “ repeat ” to listen to the system prompts again.'

The sensors can detect obstacles from approximately 12 inches (30 cm) up to 79 inches (200 cm) from the rear fascia/bumper in the horizontal direction, depending on the location, type and orientation of the obstacle.  The six ParkSense sensors, located in the front fascia/bumper, monitor the area in front of the vehicle that is within the sensors’ field of view.  The sensors can detect obstacles from approximately 12 inches (30 cm) up to 47 inches (120 cm) from the front fascia/bumper in the horizontal direction, depending on the location, type and orientation of the obstacle.'
 ' The ParkSense Park Assist system provides visual and audible indications of the distance between the rear and/or front fascia/bumper and a detected obstacle when backing up or moving forward (e.g.  during a parking maneuver).  For system limitations and usage precautions, see ParkSense will turn off the Front Park Assist audible alert (chime) after approximately three seconds when an obstacle has been detected, the vehicle is stationary, and the brake pedal is applied.  ParkSense can be active only when the gear selector is in REVERSE or DRIVE.  If ParkSense is enabled at one of these gear selector positions, the system will remain active until the vehicle speed is increased to approximately 7 mph (11 km/h) or above.  A warning will appear in the instrument cluster display indicating the vehicle is above ParkSense operating speed.

To access the fuel filler cap, push on the fuel filler door to unlatch it.  To close the fuel filler door, push on it a second time.  If the fuel filler cap is lost or damaged, be sure the replacement cap is the correct one for this vehicle.  Open the fuel filler door.  Fuel filler door remove the fuel cap by rotating it counterclockwise.  Fuel filler cap fully insert the gasoline nozzle into the filler pipe.  Fill the vehicle with fuel.  When the fuel nozzle “clicks” or shuts off, the fuel tank is full.  Wait five seconds before removing the fuel nozzle to allow excess fuel to drain from nozzle.  Remove gasoline nozzle, reinstall fuel cap and close the fuel filler door.  WARNING: Never have any smoking materials lit in or near the vehicle when the fuel door is open or the tank is being filled.  Never add fuel when the engine is running.  This is in violation of most state and federal fire regulations and may cause the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) to turn on.  A fire may result if fuel is pumped into a portable container that is inside of a vehicle.  You could be burned.  Always place fuel containers on the ground while filling.  CAUTION: Damage to the fuel system or emission control system could result from using an improper fuel filler cap.  A poorly fitting cap could let impurities into the fuel system.  Also, a poorly fitting aftermarket cap can cause the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) to illuminate, due to fuel vapors escaping from the system.  To avoid fuel spillage and overfilling, do not “top off” the fuel tank after filling.  Note: When the fuel nozzle “clicks” or shuts off, the fuel tank is full.  Tighten the fuel filler cap about a quarter turn until you hear one click.  This is an indication that the cap is properly tightened.  If the fuel filler cap is not tightened properly, the MIL will come on.  Be sure the cap is tightened every time the vehicle is refueled.'

The vehicle could slip off the jack and fall on you.  You could be crushed.  Never put any part of your body under a vehicle that is on a jack.  If you need to get under a raised vehicle, take the vehicle to a service center where it can be raised on a lift.  Never start or run the engine while the vehicle is on a jack.  The jack is designed to be used as a tool for changing tires only.  The jack should not be used to lift the vehicle for service purposes.  The vehicle should be jacked on a firm level surface only.  Avoid ice or slippery areas.  Completely inspect the underbody of your vehicle.  Check tires, body structure, steering, suspension, driveline, and exhaust system for damage.  Inspect the radiator for mud and debris and clean as required.  Check threaded fasteners for looseness, particularly on the chassis, drivetrain components, steering, and suspension.  Retighten them, if required, and torque to the values specified in the Service Manual.  Check for accumulations of plants or brush.  These things could be a fire hazard.  They might hide damage to fuel lines, brake hoses, axle pinion seals, and propeller shafts.  After extended operation in mud, sand, water, or similar dirty conditions, have the radiator, fan, brake rotors, wheels, brake linings, and axle yokes inspected and cleaned as soon as possible.  Inspect the clutch vent holes in the manual transmission bell housing for mud and debris and clean as required.  Abrasive material in any part of the brakes may cause excessive wear or unpredictable braking.  You might not have full braking power when you need it to prevent a collision.  If you have been operating your vehicle in dirty conditions, get your brakes checked and cleaned as necessary.  If you experience unusual vibration after driving in mud, slush or similar conditions, check the wheels for impacted material.  Impacted material can cause a wheel imbalance and freeing the wheels of it will correct the situation.'

 "" If you get hung up or high-centered on an object, get out of the vehicle and try to determine what the vehicle is hung up on, where it is contacting the underbody and what is the best direction to recover the vehicle.  Depending on what you are in contact with, jack the vehicle up and place a few rocks under the tires so the weight is off of the high point when you let the vehicle down.  You can also try rocking the vehicle or winching the vehicle off the object.  You will encounter many types of terrain driving off-road.  You should be familiar with the terrain and area before proceeding.  There are many types of surface conditions: hard-packed dirt, gravel, rocks, grass, sand, mud, snow and ice.  Every surface has a different effect on your vehicle's steering, handling and traction.  Controlling your vehicle is one of the keys to successful off-road driving, so always keep a firm grip on the steering wheel and maintain a good driving posture.  Avoid sudden accelerations, turns or braking.  In most cases, there are no road signs, posted speed limits or signal lights.  Therefore, you will need to use your own good judgment on what is safe and what is not.  When on a trail, you should always be looking ahead for surface obstacles and changes in terrain.  The key is to plan your future driving route while remembering what you are currently driving over.  As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.  When approaching large rocks, choose a path which ensures you drive over the largest of them with your tires.  This will lift your undercarriage over the obstacle.  The tread of the tire is tougher and thicker than the side wall and is designed to take the abuse.  Always look ahead and make every effort to cross the large rocks with your tires.""]",It is not recommended to jack up the car on ice or slippery areas.

The following maintenance recommendations will enable you to obtain maximum benefit from the corrosion resistance built into your vehicle.'
 "" What Causes Corrosion?  Corrosion is the result of deterioration or removal of paint and protective coatings from your vehicle.  The most common causes are: road salt, dirt and moisture accumulation stone and gravel impact.  Insects, tree sap and tar.  Salt in the air near seacoast localities.  Atmospheric fallout/industrial pollutants.  Protection From Atmospheric Agents Vehicle body care requirements vary according to geographic locations and usage.  Chemicals that make roads passable in snow and ice and those that are sprayed on trees and road surfaces during other seasons are highly corrosive to the metal in your vehicle.  Outside parking, which exposes your vehicle to airborne contaminants, road surfaces on which the vehicle is operated, extreme hot or cold weather, and other extreme conditions will have an adverse effect on paint, metal trim, and underbody protection.  The following maintenance recommendations will enable you to obtain maximum benefit from the corrosion resistance built into your vehicle.  Wheel And Wheel Trim Care All wheels and wheel trim, especially aluminum and chrome plated wheels, should be cleaned regularly using mild (neutral Ph) soap and water to maintain their luster and to prevent corrosion.  Wash wheels with the same soap solution recommended for the body of the vehicle, and remember to always wash when the surfaces are not hot to the touch.  Your wheels are susceptible to deterioration caused by salt, sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, etc., and other road chemicals used to melt ice or control dust on dirt roads.  Use a soft cloth or sponge and mild soap to wipe away promptly.  Do not use harsh chemicals or a stiff brush.  They can damage the wheel’s protective coating that helps keep them from corroding and tarnishing.  When cleaning extremely dirty wheels, including excessive brake dust, care must be taken in the selection of tire and wheel cleaning chemicals and equipment to prevent damage to the wheels.  Mopar® Wheel Treatment or Mopar® Chrome Cleaner, or their equivalent, is recommended or select a non-abrasive, non-acidic cleaner for aluminum or chrome wheels.  CAUTION: Avoid products or automatic car washes that use acidic solutions or strong alkaline additives or harsh brushes.  Many aftermarket wheel cleaners and automatic car washes may damage the wheel's protective finish.  Such damage is not covered by the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  Only car wash soap, Mopar® Wheel Cleaner or equivalent is recommended.  CAUTION: Do not use scouring pads, steel wool, a bristle brush, metal polishes, or oven cleaner.  These products may damage the wheel's protective finish.  Such damage is not covered by the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  Only car wash soap, Mopar® Wheel Cleaner or equivalent is recommended.  Note: If you intend parking or storing your vehicle for an extended period after cleaning the wheels with wheel cleaner, drive your vehicle and apply the brakes to remove the water droplets from the brake components.  This activity will remove the red rust on the brake rotors and prevent vehicle vibration when braking.""
 ' ENGINE FLUIDS AND LUBRICANTS CAUTION: Mixing of engine coolant (antifreeze) other than specified Organic Additive Technology (OAT) engine coolant (antifreeze), may result in engine damage and may decrease corrosion protection.  Organic Additive Technology (OAT) engine coolant is different and should not be mixed with Hybrid Organic Additive Technology (HOAT) engine coolant (antifreeze) or any “globally compatible” coolant (antifreeze).  If a non-OAT engine coolant (antifreeze) is introduced into the cooling system in an emergency, the cooling system will need to be drained, flushed, and refilled with fresh OAT coolant (conforming to MS.90032), by an authorized dealer as soon as possible.  Do not use water alone or alcohol-based engine coolant (antifreeze) products.  Do not use additional rust inhibitors or antirust products, as they may not be compatible with the radiator engine coolant and may clog the radiator.  This vehicle has not been designed for use with propylene glycol-based engine coolant (antifreeze).  Use of propylene glycol-based engine coolant (antifreeze) is not recommended.  Note: If the vehicle is exposed to extreme cold (below 20°F or -7°C), or is required to operate at colder-than-normal conditions for prolonged periods, use climatized Number 2 diesel fuel or dilute the Number 2 diesel fuel with 50% Number 1 diesel fuel.  This will provide better protection from fuel gelling or wax-plugging of the fuel filters.']","According to the context provided, the possible consequence of using additional rust inhibitors or antirust products is that they may not be compatible with the radiator engine coolant and may clog the radiator.

train_136,Anything I should pay attention to when using voice commands?,"[' Helpful hints for using Voice Recognition: Voice commands can be used to operate the Uconnect Phone and to navigate its menu structure.  Voice commands are required after most Uconnect Phone prompts.  There are two general methods for how Voice Command works: Prior to giving a voice command, one must wait for the beep, which follows the “Listen” prompt or another prompt.  For certain operations, compound commands can be used.  For example, instead of saying “Call” and then “John Smith” and then “mobile”, the following compound command can be said: “Call John Smith mobile.” For each feature explanation in this section, only the compound command form of the voice command is given.  You can also break the commands into parts and say each part of the command when you are asked for it.  For example, you can use the compound command form voice command “Search for John Smith,” or you can break the compound command form into two voice commands: “Search Contacts” and when asked, “John Smith.” Please remember, the Uconnect Phone works best when you talk in a normal conversational tone, as if speaking to someone sitting a few feet/meters away from you.  The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system.  The button on your steering wheel is also used to access the Voice Commands for the Uconnect Voice Command features if your vehicle is equipped.  Did you know: at any time, if you are not sure of what to say or want to learn a voice command, push the vr button and say “ help ”.  The system provides you with a list of commands.  Did you know: voice command for climate may only be used to adjust the interior temperature of your vehicle.  Voice Command will not work to adjust the heated seats or steering wheel if equipped.  The Voice Command button on your steering wheel is only used for “barge in” and when you are already in a call or want to make another call.  Reduce background noise.  Wind noise and passenger conversations are examples of noise that may impact recognition.  Speak clearly at a normal pace and volume while facing straight ahead.

train_137,Anything I should pay attention to when using voice commands?,"[' Helpful hints for using Voice Recognition: Voice commands can be used to operate the Uconnect Phone and to navigate its menu structure.  Voice commands are required after most Uconnect Phone prompts.  There are two general methods for how Voice Command works: Prior to giving a voice command, one must wait for the beep, which follows the “Listen” prompt or another prompt.  For certain operations, compound commands can be used.  For example, instead of saying “Call” and then “John Smith” and then “mobile”, the following compound command can be said: “Call John Smith mobile.” For each feature explanation in this section, only the compound command form of the voice command is given.  You can also break the commands into parts and say each part of the command when you are asked for it.  For example, you can use the compound command form voice command “Search for John Smith,” or you can break the compound command form into two voice commands: “Search Contacts” and when asked, “John Smith.” Please remember, the Uconnect Phone works best when you talk in a normal conversational tone, as if speaking to someone sitting a few feet/meters away from you.  The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system.  The button on your steering wheel is also used to access the Voice Commands for the Uconnect Voice Command features if your vehicle is equipped.  Did you know: at any time, if you are not sure of what to say or want to learn a voice command, push the vr button and say “ help ”.  The system provides you with a list of commands.  Did you know: voice command for climate may only be used to adjust the interior temperature of your vehicle.  Voice Command will not work to adjust the heated seats or steering wheel if equipped.  The Voice Command button on your steering wheel is only used for “barge in” and when you are already in a call or want to make another call.  Reduce background noise.

CAUTION: Do not use a portable battery booster pack or any other booster source with a system voltage greater than 12 Volts or damage to the battery, starter motor, alternator or electrical system may occur.  Note: When using a portable battery booster pack, follow the manufacturer's operating instructions and precautions.  Preparations For Jump Start The battery in your vehicle is located in the right rear of the engine compartment.  If your vehicle is equipped with a Stop/Start system, it will be equipped with two batteries See the following steps to prepare for jump starting: Apply the parking brake, shift the automatic transmission into PARK (P) (manual transmission in NEUTRAL) and place the ignition in OFF mode.  Turn off the heater, radio, and all electrical accessories.  If using another vehicle to jump start the battery, park the vehicle within the jumper cable’s reach, apply the parking brake and make sure the ignition is OFF.  WARNING: Only use the positive battery post on the main battery to jump start your vehicle.  Serious injury or death could result if you attempt to jump start using the supplemental battery.  Battery gas is flammable and explosive.  Keep flame or sparks away from the battery.  Do not use a booster battery or any other booster source with an output greater than 12 Volts.  Do not allow cable clamps to touch each other.  Battery posts, terminals, and related accessories contain lead and lead compounds.  Wash hands after handling.  If a “fast charger” is used while the battery is in the vehicle, disconnect both vehicle battery cables before connecting the charger to the battery.  Do not use a “fast charger” to provide starting.  Note: the positive (+) battery post is covered with a protective cap.  Lift up on the cap to gain access to the post.  WARNING: Do not allow vehicles to touch each other as this could establish a ground connection and personal injury could result.  Take care to avoid the radiator cooling fan whenever the hood is raised.  It can start anytime the ignition switch is ON.  You can be injured by moving fan blades.  Remove any metal jewelry such as rings, watch bands and bracelets that could make an inadvertent electrical contact.  You could be seriously injured.  Batteries contain sulfuric acid that can burn your skin or eyes and generate hydrogen gas which is flammable and explosive.  Keep open flames or sparks away from the battery.  Jump Starting Procedure WARNING: Failure to follow this jump starting procedure could result in personal injury or property damage due to battery explosion.  CAUTION: Failure to follow these procedures could result in damage to the charging system of the booster vehicle or the discharged vehicle.  Note: Make sure at all times that unused ends of jumper cables are not contacting each other or either vehicle while making connections.""

Note: When using a portable battery booster pack, follow the manufacturer's operating instructions and precautions.  Maintenance-Free Battery Your vehicle is equipped with a maintenance-free battery.  You will never have to add water, and periodic maintenance is not required.  WARNING: Battery fluid is a corrosive acid solution and can burn or even blind you.  Do not allow battery fluid to contact your eyes, skin, or clothing.  Do not lean over a battery when attaching clamps.  If acid splashes in eyes or on skin, flush the area immediately with large amounts of water Battery gas is flammable and explosive.  Keep flame or sparks away from the battery.  Do not use a booster battery or any other booster source with an output greater than 12 Volts.  Do not allow cable clamps to touch each other.  Battery posts, terminals, and related accessories contain lead and lead compounds.  Wash hands after handling.  Vehicles with the Stop/Start system will be equipped with two batteries.  Both the main and the supplemental batteries must be disconnected to completely de-energize the 12 Volt electrical system.  Serious injury or death could result if you do not disconnect both batteries.  To learn how to properly disconnect, see an authorized dealer.  CAUTION: It is essential when replacing the cables on the battery that the positive cable is attached to the positive post and the negative cable is attached to the negative post.  Battery posts are marked positive (+) and negative (-) and are identified on the battery case.  Cable clamps should be tight on the terminal posts and free of corrosion.  If a “fast charger” is used while the battery is in the vehicle, disconnect both vehicle battery cables before connecting the charger to the battery.  Do not use a “fast charger” to provide starting voltage.  Vehicles with the Stop/Start system will be equipped with two batteries.  Both the main and the supplemental batteries must be disconnected to completely de-energize the 12 Volt electrical system.  If the negative battery cables are not isolated properly it can cause a potential power spike or surge in the system, resulting in damage to essential electrical components.  Disconnecting the jumper cables disconnect the negative (-) end of the jumper cable from the engine ground of the vehicle with the discharged battery.  Disconnect the opposite end of the negative (-) jumper cable from the negative (-) post of the booster battery.  Disconnect the positive (+) end of the jumper cable from the positive (+) post of the booster battery.  Disconnect the opposite end of the positive (+) jumper cable from the positive (+) post of the discharged vehicle.  Reinstall the protective cover over the positive (+) post of the discharged vehicle.  If frequent jump starting is required to start your vehicle you should have the battery and charging system tested at an authorized dealer.  CAUTION: Accessories plugged into the vehicle power outlets draw power from the vehicle’s battery, even when not in use (i.e., cellular devices, etc.).  Eventually, if plugged in long enough without engine operation, the vehicle’s battery will discharge sufficiently to degrade battery life and/or prevent the engine from starting.""]","Yes, there is potential danger if jump starting when the battery is frozen.

 ' Introducing Voice Recognition Start using Uconnect Voice Recognition with these helpful quick tips.  It provides the key Voice Commands and tips you need to know to control your vehicle’s Voice Recognition (VR) system.  If you see the NAV icon on the bottom bar or in the Apps menus of your 8.4-inch touchscreen, you have the Uconnect 4C NAV system.  If not, you have a Uconnect 4C with 8.4-inch display system.  Natural Speech Your Uconnect Phone Voice system uses a Natural Language Voice Recognition (VR) engine.  Natural speech allows the user to speak commands in phrases or complete sentences.  The system filters out certain non-word utterances and sounds such as “ah” and “eh.” The system handles fill-in words such as “I would like to”.  The system handles multiple inputs in the same phrase or sentence such as “make a phone call” and “to Kelly Smith”.  For multiple inputs in the same phrase or sentence, the system identifies the topic or context and provides the associated follow-up prompt such as “Who do you want to call?” in the case where a phone call was requested but the specific name was not recognized.  The system utilizes continuous dialog.  When the system requires more information from the user, it will ask a question to which the user can respond without pushing the Voice Command button on the steering wheel.  Basic Voice Commands The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system.  Push the VR button After the beep, say: “ cancel ” to stop a current voice session.  “ help ” to hear a list of suggested voice commands.  “ repeat ” to listen to the system prompts again.

Diesel fuel is seldom completely free of water.  To prevent fuel system trouble, drain the accumulated water from the fuel/water separator using the fuel/water separator drain provided on the fuel filter housing.  If you buy good quality fuel and follow the listed cold weather recommendations, fuel conditioners should not be required in your vehicle.  If available in your area, a high cetane “premium” diesel fuel may offer improved cold-starting and warm-up performance.  A 12 Volt heater built into the fuel filter housing aids in preventing fuel gelling.  It is controlled by a built-in thermostat.  A Diesel Pre-Heat system both improves engine starting and reduces the amount of white smoke generated by a warming engine.'
 ' Use good quality diesel fuel from a reputable supplier in your vehicle.

train_174,"What should I do when stuck in mud, sand or snow?","["" When stuck in mud, sand, snow, or ice conditions, do not spin your vehicle's wheels above 30 mph (48 km/h), or for longer than 30 seconds continuously without stopping.  You will encounter many types of terrain driving off-road.  You should be familiar with the terrain and area before proceeding.  There are many types of surface conditions: hard-packed dirt, gravel, rocks, grass, sand, mud, snow and ice.  Every surface has a different effect on your vehicle's steering, handling and traction.  Controlling your vehicle is one of the keys to successful off-road driving, so always keep a firm grip on the steering wheel and maintain a good driving posture.  Avoid sudden accelerations, turns or braking.  In most cases, there are no road signs, posted speed limits or signal lights.  Therefore, you will need to use your own good judgment on what is safe and what is not.  When on a trail, you should always be looking ahead for surface obstacles and changes in terrain.  The key is to plan your future driving route while remembering what you are currently driving over.  If your vehicle becomes stuck in mud, sand or snow, it can often be moved using a rocking motion.  Turn the steering wheel right and left to clear the area around the front wheels.  For vehicles with automatic transmission, push and hold the lock button on the gear selector.  Then, shift back and forth between DRIVE (D) and REVERSE (R) (with automatic transmission) or SECOND (2) gear and REVERSE (R) (with manual transmission), while gently pressing the accelerator.  Use the least amount of accelerator pedal pressure that will maintain the rocking motion, without spinning the wheels or racing the engine.  Deep mud creates a great deal of suction around the tires and is very difficult to get through.  You should use DRIVE, with the transfer case in the 4L position to maintain your momentum.  If you start to slow to a stop, try turning your steering wheel no more than a quarter turn quickly back and forth for additional traction.

 ' If you get hung up or high-centered on an object, get out of the vehicle and try to determine what the vehicle is hung up on, where it is contacting the underbody and what is the best direction to recover the vehicle.  Depending on what you are in contact with, jack the vehicle up and place a few rocks under the tires so the weight is off of the high point when you let the vehicle down.  You can also try rocking the vehicle or winching the vehicle off the object.  Do not attempt to change a tire on the side of the vehicle close to moving traffic.  Pull far enough off the road to avoid the danger of being hit when operating the jack or changing the wheel.  Being under a jacked-up vehicle is dangerous.  The vehicle could slip off the jack and fall on you.  You could be crushed.  Never put any part of your body under a vehicle that is on a jack.  If you need to get under a raised vehicle, take the vehicle to a service center where it can be raised on a lift.  Never start or run the engine while the vehicle is on a jack.  The jack is designed to be used as a tool for changing tires only.  The jack should not be used to lift the vehicle for service purposes.  The vehicle should be jacked on a firm level surface only.  Avoid ice or slippery areas.  Completely inspect the underbody of your vehicle.  Check tires, body structure, steering, suspension, driveline, and exhaust system for damage.  Inspect the radiator for mud and debris and clean as required.  Check threaded fasteners for looseness, particularly on the chassis, drivetrain components, steering, and suspension.  Retighten them, if required, and torque to the values specified in the Service Manual.  Check for accumulations of plants or brush.  These things could be a fire hazard.  They might hide damage to fuel lines, brake hoses, axle pinion seals, and propeller shafts.  After extended operation in mud, sand, water, or similar dirty conditions, have the radiator, fan, brake rotors, wheels, brake linings, and axle yokes inspected and cleaned as soon as possible.  Inspect the clutch vent holes in the manual transmission bell housing for mud and debris and clean as required.  Abrasive material in any part of the brakes may cause excessive wear or unpredictable braking.  You might not have full braking power when you need it to prevent a collision.  If you have been operating your vehicle in dirty conditions, get your brakes checked and cleaned as necessary.  If you experience unusual vibration after driving in mud, slush or similar conditions, check the wheels for impacted material.  Impacted material can cause a wheel imbalance and freeing the wheels of it will correct the situation.']","When stuck in mud, sand, or snow, you can try using a rocking motion to free your vehicle.

train_175,"What should I do when stuck in mud, sand or snow?","["" When stuck in mud, sand, snow, or ice conditions, do not spin your vehicle's wheels above 30 mph (48 km/h), or for longer than 30 seconds continuously without stopping.  You will encounter many types of terrain driving off-road.  You should be familiar with the terrain and area before proceeding.  There are many types of surface conditions: hard-packed dirt, gravel, rocks, grass, sand, mud, snow and ice.  Every surface has a different effect on your vehicle's steering, handling and traction.  Controlling your vehicle is one of the keys to successful off-road driving, so always keep a firm grip on the steering wheel and maintain a good driving posture.  Avoid sudden accelerations, turns or braking.  In most cases, there are no road signs, posted speed limits or signal lights.  Therefore, you will need to use your own good judgment on what is safe and what is not.  When on a trail, you should always be looking ahead for surface obstacles and changes in terrain.  The key is to plan your future driving route while remembering what you are currently driving over.  If your vehicle becomes stuck in mud, sand or snow, it can often be moved using a rocking motion.  Turn the steering wheel right and left to clear the area around the front wheels.  For vehicles with automatic transmission, push and hold the lock button on the gear selector.

An unrestrained pet will be thrown about and possibly injured, or injure a passenger during panic braking or in a collision.  Pets should be restrained in the rear seat (if equipped) in pet harnesses or pet carriers that are secured by seat belts.  Washing Wash your vehicle regularly.  Always wash your vehicle in the shade using Mopar® Car Wash, or a mild car wash soap, and rinse the panels completely with water.  If insects, tar, or other similar deposits have accumulated on your vehicle, use Mopar® Super Kleen Bug and Tar Remover to remove.  Use a high quality cleaner wax, such as Mopar® Cleaner Wax, to remove road film and stains, and to protect your paint finish.  Use precautions to not scratch the paint.  Avoid using abrasive compounds and power buffing that may diminish the gloss or thin out the paint finish.  CAUTION: Do not use abrasive or strong cleaning materials, such as steel wool or scouring powder, that will scratch metal and painted surfaces.  Use of power washers exceeding 1,200 psi (8,274 kPa) can result in damage or removal of paint and decals.  STARTING THE ENGINE — GASOLINE ENGINE (IF EQUIPPED) Before starting your vehicle, adjust your seat, adjust both inside and outside mirrors, and fasten your seat belts.  WARNING: When exiting the vehicle, always remove the key fob from the ignition and lock your vehicle.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.

Every state in the United States, and every Canadian province, requires that small children ride in proper restraint systems.  This is the law, and you can be prosecuted for ignoring it.  Children 12 years or younger should ride properly buckled up in a rear seat, if available.  According to crash statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seats rather than in the front.  There are different sizes and types of restraints for children from newborn size to the child almost large enough for an adult safety belt.  Always check the child seat Owner’s Manual to make sure you have the correct seat for your child.  Carefully read and follow all the instructions and warnings in the child restraint Owner’s Manual and on all the labels attached to the child restraint.  Before buying any restraint system, make sure that it has a label certifying that it meets all applicable Safety Standards.  You should also make sure that you can install it in the vehicle where you will use it.  WARNING: In a collision, an unrestrained child can become a projectile inside the vehicle.  The force required to hold even an infant on your lap could become so great that you could not hold the child, no matter how strong you are.  The child and others could be badly injured or killed.

Weight limit of the child restraint always use the tether anchor when using the seat belt to install a forward-facing child restraint, up to the recommended weight limit of the child restraint.  Can the rear-facing child restraint touch the back of the front passenger seat?  Yes contact between the front passenger seat and the child restraint is allowed, if the child restraint manufacturer also allows contact.  Can the rear head restraints be removed?  Yes the center head restraint can be removed if it interferes with the installation of the child restraint.  Can the buckle stalk be twisted to tighten the seat belt against the belt path of the child restraint?  No do not twist the buckle stalk in a seating position with an alr retractor.  Children Too Large For Booster Seats Children who are large enough to wear the shoulder belt comfortably, and whose legs are long enough to bend over the front of the seat when their back is against the seatback, should use the seat belt in a rear seat.  Use this simple 5-step test to decide whether the child can use the vehicle’s seat belt alone: Can the child sit all the way back against the back of the vehicle seat?  Do the child’s knees bend comfortably over the front of the vehicle seat while the child is still sitting all the way back?  Does the shoulder belt cross the child’s shoulder between the neck and arm?  Is the lap part of the belt as low as possible, touching the child’s thighs and not the stomach?  Can the child stay seated like this for the whole trip?  If the answer to any of these questions was “no,” then the child still needs to use a booster seat in this vehicle.  If the child is using the lap/shoulder belt, check seat belt fit periodically and make sure the seat belt buckle is latched.  A child’s squirming or slouching can move the belt out of position.  If the shoulder belt contacts the face or neck, move the child closer to the center of the vehicle, or use a booster seat to position the seat belt on the child correctly.  WARNING: Never allow a child to put the shoulder belt under an arm or behind their back.  In a crash, the shoulder belt will not protect a child properly, which may result in serious injury or death.  A child must always wear both the lap and shoulder portions of the seat belt correctly.'

 ' If required for certain off-road uses, the windshield can be folded down.  However, the protection afforded by the windshield is then lost.  If you fold down the windshield, drive slowly and cautiously.  It is recommended that the speed of the vehicle be limited to 10 mph (16 km/h), with low range operation preferred if you are driving off-road with the windshield folded down.  Do not drive your vehicle on-road with the windshield down.  Do not drive your vehicle unless the windshield is securely fastened, either up or down.  Eye protection, such as goggles, should be worn at all times when the windshield is down.  Be sure that you carefully follow the instructions for raising the windshield.  Make sure that the folding windshield, windshield wipers, side bars, and all associated hardware and fasteners are correctly and tightly assembled before driving your vehicle.  Failure to follow these instructions may prevent your vehicle from providing you and your passengers’ protection in some accidents.  If you remove the doors, store them outside the vehicle.  In the event of an accident, a loose door may cause personal injury.  Raise the windshield as soon as the task that required its removal is completed and before you return to on-road driving.

CAUTION: If oil pressure falls to less than normal readings, shut the engine off immediately.  Failure to do so could result in immediate and severe engine damage.  Checking Oil Level To ensure proper engine lubrication, the engine oil must be maintained at the correct level.  Check the oil level at regular intervals, such as every fuel stop.  The best time to check the engine oil level is about five minutes after a fully warmed up engine is shut off.  Checking the oil while the vehicle is on level ground will improve the accuracy of the oil level readings.  There are four possible dipstick types: Crosshatched zone.  Crosshatched zone marked SAFE.  Crosshatched zone marked with MIN at the low end of the range and MAX at the high end of the range.  Crosshatched zone marked with dimples at the MIN and the MAX ends of the range.  Adding 1 qt (1 L) of oil when the reading is at the low end of the dipstick range will raise the oil level to the high end of the range marking.  Note: Always maintain the oil level within the crosshatch markings on the dipstick.  CAUTION: Overfilling or underfilling the crankcase will cause aeration or loss of oil pressure.  This could damage your engine.'
 ' Warm up the engine before placing it under load.  Do not operate the engine at idle for prolonged periods.  Use the appropriate transmission gear to prevent engine lugging.  Observe vehicle oil pressure and temperature indicators.  Check the coolant and oil levels frequently.  Vary throttle position at highway speeds when carrying or towing significant weight.

   - Underfilling the crankcase can cause a loss of oil pressure, as mentioned in the ""CAUTION"" section.

2. Engine damage:
   - The text states that if the oil pressure falls to less than normal readings, the engine should be shut off immediately to prevent ""immediate and severe engine damage.""
   - This suggests that engine damage, such as worn bearings or other internal issues, can lead to a loss of oil pressure.

3. Mechanical failure:
   - The text advises to contact an authorized dealer if the Oil Pressure Warning Light remains illuminated after restarting the engine, as the cause may need to be corrected.
   - This implies that a mechanical failure, such as a problem with the oil pump or oil passages, could be the underlying cause of the low oil pressure.

Note: The Vehicle Security system will not arm if you lock the doors using the manual door lock.  VEHICLE SECURITY SYSTEM — IF EQUIPPED The Vehicle Security system monitors the vehicle doors for unauthorized entry and the ignition switch for unauthorized operation.  When the system is activated, the interior switches for door locks are disabled.  The Vehicle Security system provides both audible and visible signals.  If something triggers the alarm, the Vehicle Security system will provide the following audible and visible signals: the horn will pulse, the parking lights and/or turn signals will flash, and the Vehicle Security Light in the instrument cluster will flash.  SENTRY KEY The Sentry Key Immobilizer system prevents unauthorized vehicle operation by disabling the engine.  The system does not need to be armed or activated.  Operation is automatic, regardless of whether the vehicle is locked or unlocked.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.  Therefore, only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  The system cannot reprogram a key fob obtained from another vehicle.  After placing the ignition switch in the ON/RUN position, the Vehicle Security Light will turn on for three seconds for a bulb check.  If the light remains on after the bulb check, it indicates that there is a problem with the electronics.  In addition, if the light begins to flash after the bulb check, it indicates that someone attempted to start the engine with an invalid key fob.  In the event that a valid key fob is used to start the engine but there is an issue with the vehicle electronics, the engine will start and shut off after two seconds.  If the Vehicle Security Light turns on during normal vehicle operation (vehicle running for longer than ten seconds), it indicates that there is a fault in the electronics.  Should this occur, have the vehicle serviced as soon as possible by an authorized dealer.  All of the key fobs provided with your new vehicle have been programmed to the vehicle electronics CAUTION: The Sentry Key Immobilizer system is not compatible with some aftermarket remote starting systems.  Use of these systems may result in vehicle starting problems and loss of security protection.  Note: A key fob that has not been programmed is also considered an invalid key.'

Note: The Vehicle Security system will not arm if you lock the doors using the manual door lock.  VEHICLE SECURITY SYSTEM — IF EQUIPPED The Vehicle Security system monitors the vehicle doors for unauthorized entry and the ignition switch for unauthorized operation.  When the system is activated, the interior switches for door locks are disabled.  The Vehicle Security system provides both audible and visible signals.  If something triggers the alarm, the Vehicle Security system will provide the following audible and visible signals: the horn will pulse, the parking lights and/or turn signals will flash, and the Vehicle Security Light in the instrument cluster will flash.  SENTRY KEY The Sentry Key Immobilizer system prevents unauthorized vehicle operation by disabling the engine.  The system does not need to be armed or activated.  Operation is automatic, regardless of whether the vehicle is locked or unlocked.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.  Therefore, only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  The system cannot reprogram a key fob obtained from another vehicle.  After placing the ignition switch in the ON/RUN position, the Vehicle Security Light will turn on for three seconds for a bulb check.  If the light remains on after the bulb check, it indicates that there is a problem with the electronics.  In addition, if the light begins to flash after the bulb check, it indicates that someone attempted to start the engine with an invalid key fob.  In the event that a valid key fob is used to start the engine but there is an issue with the vehicle electronics, the engine will start and shut off after two seconds.  If the Vehicle Security Light turns on during normal vehicle operation (vehicle running for longer than ten seconds), it indicates that there is a fault in the electronics.  Should this occur, have the vehicle serviced as soon as possible by an authorized dealer.  All of the key fobs provided with your new vehicle have been programmed to the vehicle electronics CAUTION: The Sentry Key Immobilizer system is not compatible with some aftermarket remote starting systems.  Use of these systems may result in vehicle starting problems and loss of security protection.  Note: A key fob that has not been programmed is also considered an invalid key.'

In the event of an accident, a loose door may cause personal injury.  Raise the windshield as soon as the task that required its removal is completed and before you return to on-road driving.  Both you and your passengers should wear seat belts at all times, on-road and off-road, regardless of whether the windshield is raised or folded down.'
 ' If the temperature is below 72°F (24°C) and/or the top has been folded down for a period of time, the top will appear to have shrunk when you raise it, making it difficult to put up.  This is caused by a natural contraction of the vinyl or acrylic materials of the fabric top.  If required for certain off-road uses, the windshield can be folded down.  However, the protection afforded by the windshield is then lost.  If you fold down the windshield, drive slowly and cautiously.  It is recommended that the speed of the vehicle be limited to 10 mph (16 km/h), with low range operation preferred if you are driving off-road with the windshield folded down.  The fold-down windshield on your vehicle is a structural element that can provide protection in some accidents.  The windshield also provides protection against weather, road debris and intrusion of small branches and other objects.  To fold down the rear seat, pull the release strap located on the upper outboard side of the rear seat to release the seat.  The head restraints are folded independently Position the latch plate as close as possible to the anchor point.  At about 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) above the latch plate, grab and twist the seat belt webbing 180 degrees to create a fold that begins immediately above the latch plate.  Slide the latch plate upward over the folded webbing.  The folded webbing must enter the slot at the top of the latch plate.  Continue to slide the latch plate up until it clears the folded webbing and the seat belt is no longer twisted.  Be sure that the front seats are fully upright and positioned forward.  This will allow the rear seat to fold down easily.  The center head restraints must be in the lowest position to avoid contact with the center console when folding the seat.  Do not drive your vehicle on-road with the windshield down.  Do not drive your vehicle unless the windshield is securely fastened, either up or down.  Eye protection, such as goggles, should be worn at all times when the windshield is down.  Be sure that you carefully follow the instructions for raising the windshield.  Make sure that the folding windshield, windshield wipers, side bars, and all associated hardware and fasteners are correctly and tightly assembled before driving your vehicle.

This condition will disappear as the engine warms up.  Warm up the engine before placing it under load.  Do not operate the engine at idle for prolonged periods.  Use the appropriate transmission gear to prevent engine lugging.  Observe vehicle oil pressure and temperature indicators.  Check the coolant and oil levels frequently.  Vary throttle position at highway speeds when carrying or towing significant weight.  If temperatures are below 32°F (0°C), operate the engine at moderate speeds for five minutes before full loads are applied.  Avoid full throttle operation when the engine is cold.  When starting a cold engine, bring the engine up to operating speed slowly to allow the oil pressure to stabilize as the engine warms up.  After full load operation, idle the engine for a few minutes before shutting it down.  This idle period will allow the lubricating oil and coolant to carry excess heat away from the turbocharger.'

train_314,What may cause a rollover accident?,"[' ROLLOVER WARNING Utility vehicles have a significantly higher rollover rate than other types of vehicles.  This vehicle has a higher ground clearance and a higher center of gravity than many passenger vehicles.  It is capable of performing better in a wide variety of off-road applications.  Driven in an unsafe manner, all vehicles can go out of control.  Because of the higher center of gravity, if this vehicle is out of control it may roll over while some other vehicles may not.  Do not attempt sharp turns, abrupt maneuvers, or other unsafe driving actions that can cause loss of vehicle control.  Failure to operate this vehicle safely may result in a collision, rollover of the vehicle, and severe or fatal injury.  Drive carefully.  Failure to use the driver and passenger seat belts provided is a major cause of severe or fatal injury.  In fact, the US government notes that the universal use of existing seat belts could cut the highway death toll by 10,000 or more each year and could reduce disabling injuries by two million annually.  In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt.  Always buckle up.'

Never attempt to cross a fast running stream or river even in shallow water.  Fast moving water can easily push your vehicle downstream, sweeping it out of control.  Even in very shallow water, a high current can still wash the dirt out from around your tires putting you and your vehicle in jeopardy.  There is still a high risk of personal injury and vehicle damage with slower water currents in depths greater than the vehicle\'s running ground clearance.  You should never attempt to cross flowing water which is deeper than the vehicle\'s running ground clearance.  Even the slowest current can push the heaviest vehicle downstream and out of control if the water is deep enough to push on the large surface area of the vehicle\'s body.  Before you proceed, determine the speed of the current, the water\'s depth, approach angle, bottom condition and if there are any obstacles.  Then cross at an angle heading slightly upstream using the low and slow technique.  WARNING: Never drive through fast moving deep water.  It can push your vehicle downstream, sweeping it out of control.  This could put you and your passengers at risk of injury or drowning.  Driving Across An Incline If at all possible, avoid driving across an incline.  If it is necessary, know your vehicle\'s abilities.  Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, which increases the possibilities of a downhill slide or rollover.  Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.  If possible, transverse the incline at an angle heading slightly up or down.  WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.  Driving Up Hill Once you have determined your ability to proceed and have shifted into the appropriate gear, line your vehicle up for the straightest possible run.  Accelerate with an easy constant throttle and apply more power as you start up the hill.  Do not race forward into a steep grade; the abrupt change of grade could cause you to lose control.  If the front end begins to bounce, ease off the throttle slightly to bring all four tires back on the ground.  As you approach the crest of the hill, ease off the throttle and slowly proceed over the top.  If the wheels start to slip as you approach the crest of a hill, ease off the accelerator and maintain headway by turning the steering wheel no more than a quarter turn quickly back and forth.  This will provide a fresh ""bite"" into the surface and will usually provide enough traction to complete the climb.  If you do not make it to the top, place the vehicle in REVERSE and back straight down the grade using engine resistance along with the vehicle brakes.  WARNING: Never attempt to climb a hill at an angle or turn around on a steep grade.  Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.'

 "" Extreme care should be taken crossing any type of water.  Water crossings should be avoided, if possible, and only be attempted when necessary in a safe, responsible manner.  You should only drive through areas which are designated and approved.  You should tread lightly and avoid damage to the environment.  You should know your vehicle's abilities and be able to recover it if something goes wrong.  You should never stop or shut a vehicle off when crossing deep water unless you ingested water into the engine air intake.  If the engine stalls, do not attempt to restart it.  Determine if it has ingested water first.  The key to any crossing is low and slow.  Shift into FIRST gear (manual transmission), or DRIVE (automatic transmission), with the transfer case in the 4L position and proceed very slowly with a constant slow speed (3 to 5 mph {5 to 8 km/h} maximum) and light throttle.  Keep the vehicle moving; do not try to accelerate through the crossing.  After crossing any water higher than the bottom of the axle differentials, you should inspect all of the vehicle fluids for signs of water ingestion.  Water ingestion into the axles, transmission, transfer case, engine or vehicle interior can occur if you drive too fast or through too deep of water.  Water can cause permanent damage to engine, driveline or other vehicle components, and your brakes will be less effective once wet and/or muddy.  When driving through water, do not exceed 5 mph (8 km/h).  Always check water depth before entering as a precaution, and check all fluids afterward.  Driving through water may cause damage that may not be covered by the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  As you approach any type of water, you need to determine if you can cross it safely and responsibly.  If necessary, get out and walk through the water or probe it with a stick.  You need to be sure of its depth, approach angle, current and bottom condition.  Be careful of murky or muddy waters; check for hidden obstacles.  Make sure you will not be intruding on any wildlife, and you can recover the vehicle if necessary.  The key to a safe crossing is the water depth, current and bottom conditions.  On soft bottoms, the vehicle will sink in, effectively increasing the water level on the vehicle.  Be sure to consider this when determining the depth and the ability to safely cross.  Puddles, pools, flooded or other standing water areas normally contain murky or muddy waters.  These water types normally contain hidden obstacles and make it difficult to determine an accurate water depth, approach angle, and bottom condition.

train_329,Is it possible to drive across a shallow river?,"[' Crossing Ditches, Streams, Shallow Rivers Or Other Flowing Water Flowing water can be extremely dangerous.  Never attempt to cross a fast running stream or river even in shallow water.  Fast moving water can easily push your vehicle downstream, sweeping it out of control.  Even in very shallow water, a high current can still wash the dirt out from around your tires putting you and your vehicle in jeopardy.  There is still a high risk of personal injury and vehicle damage with slower water currents in depths greater than the vehicle\'s running ground clearance.  You should never attempt to cross flowing water which is deeper than the vehicle\'s running ground clearance.  Even the slowest current can push the heaviest vehicle downstream and out of control if the water is deep enough to push on the large surface area of the vehicle\'s body.  Before you proceed, determine the speed of the current, the water\'s depth, approach angle, bottom condition and if there are any obstacles.  Then cross at an angle heading slightly upstream using the low and slow technique.  WARNING: Never drive through fast moving deep water.  It can push your vehicle downstream, sweeping it out of control.  This could put you and your passengers at risk of injury or drowning.  Driving Across An Incline If at all possible, avoid driving across an incline.  If it is necessary, know your vehicle\'s abilities.  Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, which increases the possibilities of a downhill slide or rollover.  Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.  If possible, transverse the incline at an angle heading slightly up or down.  WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.  Driving Up Hill Once you have determined your ability to proceed and have shifted into the appropriate gear, line your vehicle up for the straightest possible run.  Accelerate with an easy constant throttle and apply more power as you start up the hill.  Do not race forward into a steep grade; the abrupt change of grade could cause you to lose control.  If the front end begins to bounce, ease off the throttle slightly to bring all four tires back on the ground.  As you approach the crest of the hill, ease off the throttle and slowly proceed over the top.  If the wheels start to slip as you approach the crest of a hill, ease off the accelerator and maintain headway by turning the steering wheel no more than a quarter turn quickly back and forth.  This will provide a fresh ""bite"" into the surface and will usually provide enough traction to complete the climb.  If you do not make it to the top, place the vehicle in REVERSE and back straight down the grade using engine resistance along with the vehicle brakes.  WARNING: Never attempt to climb a hill at an angle or turn around on a steep grade.  Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.'

 "" Extreme care should be taken crossing any type of water.  Water crossings should be avoided, if possible, and only be attempted when necessary in a safe, responsible manner.  You should only drive through areas which are designated and approved.  You should tread lightly and avoid damage to the environment.  You should know your vehicle's abilities and be able to recover it if something goes wrong.  You should never stop or shut a vehicle off when crossing deep water unless you ingested water into the engine air intake.  If the engine stalls, do not attempt to restart it.  Determine if it has ingested water first.  The key to any crossing is low and slow.  Shift into FIRST gear (manual transmission), or DRIVE (automatic transmission), with the transfer case in the 4L position and proceed very slowly with a constant slow speed (3 to 5 mph {5 to 8 km/h} maximum) and light throttle.

See ""⇨blind spot modes"" for further information.  The BSM system monitors the detection zone from three different entry points (side, rear, front) while driving to see if an alert is necessary.  The BSM system will issue an alert during these types of zone entries.  When the BSM system is turned off there will be no visual or audible alerts from either the BSM or RCP systems.  When the vehicle is started, the BSM Warning Light will momentarily illuminate in both outside rearview mirrors to let the driver know that the system is operational.  The BSM system sensors operate when the vehicle is in any forward gear.  The BSM detection zone covers approximately one lane width on both sides of the vehicle 12 ft (3.8 m).  The zone starts at the outside rearview mirror and extends approximately 10 ft (3 m) beyond the rear fascia/bumper of the vehicle.  The BSM system monitors the detection zones on both sides of the vehicle when the vehicle speed reaches approximately 6 mph (10 km/h) or higher and will alert the driver of vehicles in these areas.  BSM Radar Location (Left Side Shown) The BSM system will store the current operating mode when the vehicle is shut off.  Each time the vehicle is started the previously stored mode will be recalled and used.'
 ' Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM) — If Equipped The BSM system uses two radar sensors, located inside the taillights, to detect highway licensable vehicles (automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, etc.)  that enter the blind spot zones from the rear/front/side of the vehicle.  When the vehicle is started, the BSM Warning Light will momentarily illuminate in both outside rearview mirrors to let the driver know that the system is operational.  The BSM system sensors operate when the vehicle is in any forward gear.  The BSM detection zone covers approximately one lane width on both sides of the vehicle 12 ft (3.8 m).  The zone starts at the outside rearview mirror and extends approximately 10 ft (3 m) beyond the rear fascia/bumper of the vehicle.  The BSM system monitors the detection zones on both sides of the vehicle when the vehicle speed reaches approximately 6 mph (10 km/h) or higher and will alert the driver of vehicles in these areas.  The BSM system can become blocked if snow, ice, mud, or other road contaminations accumulate on the rear fascia/bumper where the radar sensors are located.  The system may also detect a blockage if the vehicle is operated in areas with extremely low radar returns, such as a desert, or parallel to a large elevation drop.  If a blockage is detected, a “Blind Spot Temporarily Unavailable, Wipe Rear Corners” message will display in the instrument cluster, both mirror lights will illuminate, and BSM and RCP alerts will be disabled.  This is normal operation.  The system will automatically resume function when the condition clears.  To minimize system blockage, do not block the area of the rear fascia/bumper where the radar sensors are located with foreign objects (bumper stickers, bicycle racks, etc.)  and keep it clear of road contaminations.  The BSM system notifies the driver of objects in the detection zones by illuminating the BSM Warning Light located in the outside mirrors in addition to sounding an audible (chime) alert and reducing the radio volume.  See ""⇨blind spot modes"" for further information.  The BSM system monitors the detection zone from three different entry points (side, rear, front) while driving to see if an alert is necessary.  The BSM system will issue an alert during these types of zone entries.  Note: The BSM system DOES NOT alert the driver about rapidly approaching vehicles that are outside the detection zones.  The BSM system detection zone DOES NOT change if your vehicle is towing a trailer.  Therefore, visually verify the adjacent lane is clear for both your vehicle and trailer before making a lane change.  If the trailer or other object (i.e., bicycle, sports equipment) extends beyond the side of your vehicle, this may result in the BSM Warning Light remaining illuminated the entire time the vehicle is in a forward gear.  See ""⇨uconnect settings"" for more information.  The Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM) system may experience dropouts (blinking on and off) of the side mirror warning indicator lights when a motorcycle or any small object remains at the side of the vehicle for extended periods of time (more than a couple of seconds).'

 "" There is a 12 Volt (13 A) auxiliary power outlet that can provide power for accessories designed for use with the standard power outlet adapters.  Do not exceed the maximum power of 160 W (13 A) at 12 Volts.  If the 160 W (13 A) power rating is exceeded, the fuse protecting the system will need to be replaced.  Power outlets are designed for accessory plugs only.  Do not insert any other object in the power outlets as this will damage the outlet and blow the fuse.  Improper use of the power outlet can cause damage not covered by your New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  Many accessories that can be plugged in draw power from the vehicle's battery, even when not in use (i.e., cellular phones, etc.).  Eventually, if plugged in long enough, the vehicle's battery will discharge sufficiently to degrade battery life and/or prevent the engine from starting.  Accessories that draw higher power (i.e., coolers, vacuum cleaners, lights, etc.  ), will degrade the battery even more quickly.  Only use these intermittently and with greater caution.  After the use of high power draw accessories, or long periods of the vehicle not being started (with accessories still plugged in), the vehicle must be driven a sufficient length of time to allow the alternator to recharge the vehicle's battery.  Power outlets are designed for accessory plugs only.  Do not hang any type of accessory or accessory bracket from the plug.  Improper use of the power outlet can cause damage The front power outlet is located in the center of the instrument panel below the climate controls, and is powered from the ignition switch.

train_346,What's the maximum load for each cleat on the truck bed?,"[' BED RAIL TIE DOWN SYSTEM — IF EQUIPPED The Bed Rail Tie Down system allows you to properly secure cargo in the truck bed.  There are two adjustable utility rail cleats on each side of the bed that can be used to assist in securing cargo.  Each utility rail cleat must be tightened down in one of the detents along either utility rail in order to keep cargo properly secured.  To move the utility rail cleat to any position on the utility rail, turn the cleat retainer nut counterclockwise several times.  Then, pull out on the utility rail cleat and slide it to the detent nearest the desired location.  Make sure the utility rail cleat is seated in the detent, and tighten the nut.  To remove the utility rail cleats from the side utility rails, slide the cleat to the rectangular cutout located at the end of the rail toward the front of the vehicle.  To remove the utility rail cleat from the front utility rail, slide the cleat to the rectangular cutout located on the left side of the rail.  CAUTION: The maximum load per cleat should not exceed 250 lb (113 kg) and the angle of the load on each cleat should not exceed 45 degrees above horizontal, or damage to the cleat or cleat rail may occur.'
 ' The Tonneau Cover can be installed on the truck bed to keep cargo out of view, and protect from inclement weather.  Crossbars should always be used whenever cargo is placed on the roof rack.  Check the straps frequently to be sure that the load remains securely attached.  Remember that everything put into or on the trailer adds to the load on your vehicle.  Also, additional factory-installed options or dealer-installed options must be considered as part of the total load on your vehicle.  Refer to the Tire And Loading Information Placard for the maximum combined weight of occupants and cargo for your vehicle.'
 "" Loading The vehicle maximum load on the tire must not exceed the load carrying capacity of the tire on your vehicle.  You will not exceed the tire's load carrying capacity if you adhere to the loading conditions, tire size, and cold tire inflation pressures specified on the Tire And Loading Information PlacardTo determine the maximum loading conditions of your vehicle, locate the statement “The combined weight of occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs” on the Tire And Loading Information Placard.  The combined weight of occupants, cargo/luggage and trailer tongue weight (if applicable) should never exceed the weight referenced here.  Note: Under a maximum loaded vehicle condition, gross axle weight ratings (GAWRs) for the front and rear axles must not be exceeded.  For further information on GAWRs, vehicle loading, and trailer towing, see Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) The GAWR is the maximum capacity of the front and rear axles.  Distribute the load over the front and rear axles evenly.  Make sure that you do not exceed either front or rear GAWR WARNING: It is important that you do not exceed the maximum front or rear GAWR.  A dangerous driving condition can result if either rating is exceeded.  Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) The GAWR is the maximum permissible load on the front and rear axles.  The load must be distributed in the cargo area so that the GAWR of each axle is not exceeded.  Each axle GAWR is determined by the components in the system with the lowest load carrying capacity (axle, springs, tires or wheels).

It provides the key Voice Commands and tips you need to know to control your vehicle’s Voice Recognition (VR) system.  If you see the NAV icon on the bottom bar or in the Apps menus of your 8.4-inch touchscreen, you have the Uconnect 4C NAV system.  If not, you have a Uconnect 4C with 8.4-inch display system.  Natural Speech Your Uconnect Phone Voice system uses a Natural Language Voice Recognition (VR) engine.  Natural speech allows the user to speak commands in phrases or complete sentences.  The system filters out certain non-word utterances and sounds such as “ah” and “eh.” The system handles fill-in words such as “I would like to”.  The system handles multiple inputs in the same phrase or sentence such as “make a phone call” and “to Kelly Smith”.  For multiple inputs in the same phrase or sentence, the system identifies the topic or context and provides the associated follow-up prompt such as “Who do you want to call?” in the case where a phone call was requested but the specific name was not recognized.  The system utilizes continuous dialog.  When the system requires more information from the user, it will ask a question to which the user can respond without pushing the Voice Command button on the steering wheel.  Basic Voice Commands The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system.  Push the VR button After the beep, say: “ cancel ” to stop a current voice session.  “ help ” to hear a list of suggested voice commands.  “ repeat ” to listen to the system prompts again.  Notice the visual cues that inform you of your Voice Recognition system’s status.'
 ' Helpful hints for using Voice Recognition: Voice commands can be used to operate the Uconnect Phone and to navigate its menu structure.  Voice commands are required after most Uconnect Phone prompts.  There are two general methods for how Voice Command works: Prior to giving a voice command, one must wait for the beep, which follows the “Listen” prompt or another prompt.  For certain operations, compound commands can be used.  For example, instead of saying “Call” and then “John Smith” and then “mobile”, the following compound command can be said: “Call John Smith mobile.” For each feature explanation in this section, only the compound command form of the voice command is given.  You can also break the commands into parts and say each part of the command when you are asked for it.  For example, you can use the compound command form voice command “Search for John Smith,” or you can break the compound command form into two voice commands: “Search Contacts” and when asked, “John Smith.” Please remember, the Uconnect Phone works best when you talk in a normal conversational tone, as if speaking to someone sitting a few feet/meters away from you.  The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system.  The button on your steering wheel is also used to access the Voice Commands for the Uconnect Voice Command features if your vehicle is equipped.  Did you know: at any time, if you are not sure of what to say or want to learn a voice command, push the vr button and say “ help ”.  The system provides you with a list of commands.  Did you know: voice command for climate may only be used to adjust the interior temperature of your vehicle.  Voice Command will not work to adjust the heated seats or steering wheel if equipped.  The Voice Command button on your steering wheel is only used for “barge in” and when you are already in a call or want to make another call.  Reduce background noise.  Wind noise and passenger conversations are examples of noise that may impact recognition.  Speak clearly at a normal pace and volume while facing straight ahead.  Each time you give a Voice Command, first push the VR button, wait until after the beep, then say your Voice Command.  You can interrupt the help message or system prompts by pushing the VR button and saying a Voice Command from the current category.  “ cancel ” to stop a current voice session.  “ help ” to hear a list of suggested voice commands.  “ repeat ” to listen to the system prompts again.'

train_372,what can the Uconnect Voice Recognition do?,"[' Introducing Voice Recognition Start using Uconnect Voice Recognition with these helpful quick tips.  It provides the key Voice Commands and tips you need to know to control your vehicle’s Voice Recognition (VR) system.  If you see the NAV icon on the bottom bar or in the Apps menus of your 8.4-inch touchscreen, you have the Uconnect 4C NAV system.  If not, you have a Uconnect 4C with 8.4-inch display system.  Natural Speech Your Uconnect Phone Voice system uses a Natural Language Voice Recognition (VR) engine.  Natural speech allows the user to speak commands in phrases or complete sentences.  The system filters out certain non-word utterances and sounds such as “ah” and “eh.” The system handles fill-in words such as “I would like to”.  The system handles multiple inputs in the same phrase or sentence such as “make a phone call” and “to Kelly Smith”.  For multiple inputs in the same phrase or sentence, the system identifies the topic or context and provides the associated follow-up prompt such as “Who do you want to call?” in the case where a phone call was requested but the specific name was not recognized.  The system utilizes continuous dialog.  When the system requires more information from the user, it will ask a question to which the user can respond without pushing the Voice Command button on the steering wheel.  Basic Voice Commands The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system.  Push the VR button After the beep, say: “ cancel ” to stop a current voice session.  “ help ” to hear a list of suggested voice commands.  “ repeat ” to listen to the system prompts again.  Notice the visual cues that inform you of your Voice Recognition system’s status.'
 ' Helpful hints for using Voice Recognition: Voice commands can be used to operate the Uconnect Phone and to navigate its menu structure.  Voice commands are required after most Uconnect Phone prompts.  There are two general methods for how Voice Command works: Prior to giving a voice command, one must wait for the beep, which follows the “Listen” prompt or another prompt.  For certain operations, compound commands can be used.  For example, instead of saying “Call” and then “John Smith” and then “mobile”, the following compound command can be said: “Call John Smith mobile.” For each feature explanation in this section, only the compound command form of the voice command is given.  You can also break the commands into parts and say each part of the command when you are asked for it.  For example, you can use the compound command form voice command “Search for John Smith,” or you can break the compound command form into two voice commands: “Search Contacts” and when asked, “John Smith.” Please remember, the Uconnect Phone works best when you talk in a normal conversational tone, as if speaking to someone sitting a few feet/meters away from you.  The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system.  The button on your steering wheel is also used to access the Voice Commands for the Uconnect Voice Command features if your vehicle is equipped.  Did you know: at any time, if you are not sure of what to say or want to learn a voice command, push the vr button and say “ help ”.  The system provides you with a list of commands.  Did you know: voice command for climate may only be used to adjust the interior temperature of your vehicle.  Voice Command will not work to adjust the heated seats or steering wheel if equipped.  The Voice Command button on your steering wheel is only used for “barge in” and when you are already in a call or want to make another call.  Reduce background noise.  Wind noise and passenger conversations are examples of noise that may impact recognition.  Speak clearly at a normal pace and volume while facing straight ahead.  Each time you give a Voice Command, first push the VR button, wait until after the beep, then say your Voice Command.  You can interrupt the help message or system prompts by pushing the VR button and saying a Voice Command from the current category.  “ cancel ” to stop a current voice session.  “ help ” to hear a list of suggested voice commands.  “ repeat ” to listen to the system prompts again.'

 "" Hill climbing requires good judgment and a good understanding of your abilities and your vehicle's limitations.  Hills can cause serious problems.  Some are just too steep to climb and should not be attempted.  You should always feel confident with the vehicle and your abilities.  You should always climb hills straight up and down.  Never attempt to climb a hill on an angle.  As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.  If you stall or begin to lose headway while climbing a steep hill, allow your vehicle to come to a stop and immediately apply the brake.  Restart the engine and shift into REVERSE.  Back slowly down the hill allowing engine braking to control the descent and apply your brakes, if necessary, but do not allow the tires to lock.""
 ' Driving Up Hill Once you have determined your ability to proceed and have shifted into the appropriate gear, line your vehicle up for the straightest possible run.  Accelerate with an easy constant throttle and apply more power as you start up the hill.  Do not race forward into a steep grade; the abrupt change of grade could cause you to lose control.  If the front end begins to bounce, ease off the throttle slightly to bring all four tires back on the ground.  As you approach the crest of the hill, ease off the throttle and slowly proceed over the top.  If the wheels start to slip as you approach the crest of a hill, ease off the accelerator and maintain headway by turning the steering wheel no more than a quarter turn quickly back and forth.  This will provide a fresh ""bite"" into the surface and will usually provide enough traction to complete the climb.  If you do not make it to the top, place the vehicle in REVERSE and back straight down the grade using engine resistance along with the vehicle brakes.

To install the cover, refer to the following instructions: Secure the top part of the cover so that it hinges to the header.  Swing the cover down and push on it so that it covers the opening.  Check to make sure the cover is secured properly.  Note: Be sure to remove the cover before returning the windshield to the normal position.  Store the cover in the cargo area.'
 ' Your vehicle may be equipped with a protective cover that is to be used whenever the windshield is folded down in order to protect the ACC/FCW sensor.  To install the cover, refer to the following instructions: If the “ACC/FCW Unavailable Wipe Front Radar Sensor” message occurs frequently (e.g.  more than once on every trip) without any snow, rain, mud, or other obstruction, have the radar sensor realigned at an authorized dealer.  The “ACC/FCW Unavailable Wipe Front Radar Sensor” warning will display and a chime will sound when conditions temporarily limit system performance.  Always keep the sensor clean.  Carefully wipe the sensor lens with a soft cloth.  Be cautious not to damage the sensor lens.  Do not remove any screws from the sensor.  Doing so could cause an ACC system malfunction or failure and require a sensor realignment.  If the sensor or front end of the vehicle is damaged due to a collision, see an authorized dealer for service.  Do not attach or install any accessories near the sensor, including transparent material or aftermarket grilles.  Doing so could cause an ACC system failure or malfunction.  If the “ACC/FCW Unavailable Wipe Front Radar Sensor” warning is active, Fixed Speed Cruise Control is still available.  The “ACC/FCW Limited Functionality Clean Front Windshield” warning will display and a chime will sound when conditions temporarily limit system performance.  This most often occurs at times of poor visibility, such as in snow or heavy rain and fog.  The ACC system may also become temporarily blinded due to obstructions, such as mud, dirt, or ice on windshield and fog on the inside of glass.  In these cases, the instrument cluster display will read “ACC/FCW Limited Functionality Clean Front Windshield” and the system will have degraded performance.  If the instrument cluster displays “ACC/FCW Limited Functionality” or “ACC/FCW Limited Functionality Clean Front Windshield” momentarily, there may be a condition that limits FCW functionality.  Although the vehicle is still drivable under normal conditions, the active braking may not be fully available.  Once the condition that limited the system performance is no longer present, the system will return to its full performance state.  If the problem persists, see an authorized dealer.  If the system turns off, and the instrument cluster display reads “ACC/FCW Unavailable Service Required” or “Cruise/FCW Unavailable Service Required”, there may be an internal system fault or a temporary malfunction that limits ACC functionality.  Although the vehicle is still drivable under normal conditions, ACC will be temporarily unavailable.  If this occurs, try activating ACC again later, following an ignition cycle.  If the problem persists, see an authorized dealer.  This message can sometimes be displayed while driving in adverse weather conditions.  The ACC/FCW system will recover after the vehicle has left these areas.  Under rare conditions, when the camera is not tracking any vehicles or objects in its path this warning may temporarily occur.  Changing the FCW status to “Only Warning” prevents the system from providing limited active braking, or additional brake support if the driver is not braking adequately in the event of a potential frontal collision, but maintains the audible and visual warnings.  Changing the FCW status to “Off” prevents the system from providing autonomous braking, or additional brake support if the driver is not braking adequately in the event of a potential frontal collision.  The system will retain the last setting selected by the driver after ignition shut down.  FCW may not react to irrelevant objects such as overhead objects, ground reflections, objects not in the path of the vehicle, stationary objects that are far away, oncoming traffic, or leading vehicles with the same or higher rates of speed.  FCW will be disabled like ACC, with the unavailable screens.'

 ' Brake/Transmission Shift Interlock (BTSI) System This vehicle is equipped with a BTSI system that holds the transmission gear selector in PARK unless the brakes are applied.  To shift the transmission out of PARK, the engine must be running and the brake pedal must be pressed.  The brake pedal must also be pressed to shift from NEUTRAL into DRIVE or REVERSE when the vehicle is stopped or moving at low speeds.  Ignition Park Interlock This vehicle is equipped with an Ignition Park Interlock system which requires the transmission to be in PARK before the ignition can be turned to the OFF position.  This helps the driver avoid inadvertently leaving the vehicle without placing the transmission in PARK.  This system also locks the transmission in PARK whenever the ignition is in the OFF position.  Note: The transmission is NOT locked in PARK when the ignition is in the ACC position (even though the engine will be off).  Ensure that the transmission is in park, and the ignition is off (not in acc position) before exiting the vehicle.  AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION — IF EQUIPPED You must press and hold the brake pedal while shifting out of PARK.  WARNING: Never use the PARK position as a substitute for the parking brake.  Always apply the parking brake fully when exiting the vehicle to guard against vehicle movement and possible injury or damage.  Your vehicle could move and injure you and others if it is not in PARK.  Check by trying to move the transmission gear selector out of PARK with the brake pedal released.  Make sure the transmission is in PARK before exiting the vehicle.  The transmission may not engage PARK if the vehicle is moving.  Always bring the vehicle to a complete stop before shifting to PARK, and verify that the transmission gear position indicator solidly indicates PARK (P) without blinking.  Ensure that the vehicle is completely stopped, and the PARK position is properly indicated, before exiting the vehicle.  It is dangerous to shift out of PARK or NEUTRAL if the engine speed is higher than idle speed.  If your foot is not firmly pressing the brake pedal, the vehicle could accelerate quickly forward or in reverse.  You could lose control of the vehicle and hit someone or something.  Only shift into gear when the engine is idling normally and your foot is firmly pressing the brake pedal.  Unintended movement of a vehicle could injure those in or near the vehicle.  As with all vehicles, you should never exit a vehicle while the engine is running.  Before exiting a vehicle, always come to a complete stop, then apply the parking brake, shift the transmission into PARK, and turn the ignition OFF.  When the ignition is in the OFF position, the transmission is locked in PARK, securing the vehicle against unwanted movement.  When exiting the vehicle, always make sure the ignition is in the OFF position, remove the key fob from the vehicle, and lock the vehicle.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.  Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the transmission gear selector.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle (or in a location accessible to children), and do not leave the ignition in the ACC or ON/RUN position.  A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle.  CAUTION: Shift into or out of PARK or REVERSE only after the vehicle has come to a complete stop.  Do not shift between PARK, REVERSE, NEUTRAL, or DRIVE when the engine is above idle speed.  Before shifting into any gear, make sure your foot is firmly pressing the brake pedal.'
 ' ENGINE START/STOP Button Functions — With Driver’s Foot Off The Brake Pedal (In PARK Or NEUTRAL Position) The ENGINE START/STOP button operates similar to an ignition switch.  It has three modes: OFF, ACC, and RUN.  To change the ignition modes without starting the vehicle and use the accessories, follow these steps: Starting with the ignition in the OFF position.  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button once to place the ignition to the ACC position (instrument cluster will display “ACC”).  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a second time to place the ignition to the RUN position (instrument cluster will display “ON/RUN”).  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a third time to return the ignition to the OFF position (instrument cluster will display “OFF”).  Ignition Park Interlock This vehicle is equipped with an Ignition Park Interlock system which requires the transmission to be in PARK before the ignition can be turned to the OFF position.  This helps the driver avoid inadvertently leaving the vehicle without placing the transmission in PARK.  This system also locks the transmission in PARK whenever the ignition is in the OFF position.  Note: The transmission is NOT locked in PARK when the ignition is in the ACC position (even though the engine will be off).  Ensure that the transmission is in park, and the ignition is off (not in acc position) before exiting the vehicle.  Power-Up After switching the ignition key from OFF to either the ON/RUN or ACC position, or after a language change, you must wait at least 15 seconds prior to using the system']","The Brake/Transmission Shift Interlock (BTSI) system holds the transmission gear selector in PARK unless the brakes are applied.

The obd ii system may not be ready if your vehicle was recently serviced, recently had a depleted battery or a battery replacement.  If the OBD II system should be determined not ready for the I/M test, your vehicle may fail the test.  For normal service, periodic fluid level checks are not required.  When the vehicle is serviced for other reasons the exterior surfaces of the axle assembly should be inspected.  If gear oil leakage is suspected, inspect the fluid level.  Prolonged driving with the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) on could cause damage to the vehicle control system.  It also could affect fuel economy and driveability.  If the MIL is flashing, severe catalytic converter damage and power loss will soon occur.  Immediate service is required.  Your vehicle is equipped with a sophisticated Onboard Diagnostic system called OBD II.  This system monitors the performance of the emissions, engine, and transmission control systems.  When these systems are operating properly, your vehicle will provide excellent performance and fuel economy, as well as engine emissions well within current government regulations.  Intentional tampering with the emissions control system can result in civil penalties being assessed against you.  If the vehicle is overheating, it will need to be serviced by an authorized dealer.

If the vehicle has a discharged battery, booster cables may be used to obtain a start from a booster battery or the battery in another vehicle.  This type of start can be dangerous if done improperly The use of leaded gasoline is prohibited by Federal law.  Using leaded gasoline can impair engine performance and damage the emissions control system.  An out-of-tune engine, certain fuel or ignition malfunctions can cause the catalytic converter to overheat.  If you notice a pungent burning odor or some light smoke, your engine may be out-of-tune or malfunctioning and may require immediate service.  Contact an authorized dealer for service assistance.

Damage to the fuel system or emission control system could result from using an improper fuel filler cap.  A poorly fitting cap could let impurities into the fuel system.  Also, a poorly fitting aftermarket cap can cause the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) to illuminate, due to fuel vapors escaping from the system.  To avoid fuel spillage and overfilling, do not “top off” the fuel tank after filling.  If the vehicle is exposed to extreme cold (below 20°F or -7°C), or is required to operate at colder-than-normal conditions for prolonged periods, use climatized Number 2 diesel fuel or dilute the Number 2 diesel fuel with 50% Number 1 diesel fuel.  This will provide better protection from fuel gelling or wax-plugging of the fuel filters.

train_435,do I need to do some test to check whether my car is ready for emission inspection?,"["" EMISSIONS INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.  For states and/or provinces that require an Inspection and Maintenance (I/M), this check verifies the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) is functioning and is not on when the engine is running, and that the OBD II system is ready for testing.  The obd ii system may not be ready if your vehicle was recently serviced, recently had a depleted battery or a battery replacement.  If the OBD II system should be determined not ready for the I/M test, your vehicle may fail the test.  Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  Note: if you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: the mil will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn off the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  If your obd ii system is not ready, you should see an authorized dealer or repair facility.  If your vehicle was recently serviced or had a battery failure or replacement, you may need to do nothing more than drive your vehicle as you normally would in order for your OBD II system to update.  A recheck with the previously mentioned test routine may then indicate that the system is now ready.  Regardless of whether your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, if the MIL is illuminated during normal vehicle operation you should have your vehicle serviced before going to the I/M station.  The I/M station can fail your vehicle because the MIL is on with the engine running.""

Voice commands are required after most Uconnect Phone prompts.  There are two general methods for how Voice Command works: Prior to giving a voice command, one must wait for the beep, which follows the “Listen” prompt or another prompt.  For certain operations, compound commands can be used.  For example, instead of saying “Call” and then “John Smith” and then “mobile”, the following compound command can be said: “Call John Smith mobile.” For each feature explanation in this section, only the compound command form of the voice command is given.  You can also break the commands into parts and say each part of the command when you are asked for it.  For example, you can use the compound command form voice command “Search for John Smith,” or you can break the compound command form into two voice commands: “Search Contacts” and when asked, “John Smith.” Please remember, the Uconnect Phone works best when you talk in a normal conversational tone, as if speaking to someone sitting a few feet/meters away from you.

Vehicles with diesel engines will have a cap to remove to begin the refueling process.  If refueling is necessary, while using an approved gas can, insert the refueling funnel into the filler neck opening.  Take care to open both flappers with the funnel to avoid spills.  Retrieve funnel from under the right rear seat.  Fuel Funnel Location Refueling Funnel Remove the fuel filler cap and insert the funnel into same filler pipe opening as the fuel nozzle.  Inserting Funnel Ensure funnel is inserted fully to hold flapper doors open.  Pour fuel into funnel opening.  To avoid fuel spillage and overfilling, do not “top off” the fuel tank after filling.  Remove funnel from filler pipe, clean off prior to putting back in the spare tire storage area.  Tighten the fuel filler cap until clicking is heard.  This is an indication the cap is properly tightened.  After an accident, remember to cycle the ignition to the STOP (OFF/LOCK) position and remove the key from the ignition switch to avoid draining the battery.  Carefully check the vehicle for fuel leaks in the engine compartment and on the ground near the engine compartment and fuel tank before resetting the system and starting the engine.  If there are no fuel leaks or damage to the vehicle electrical devices (e.g.  headlights) after an accident, reset the system by following the procedure described below.  If you have any doubt, contact an authorized dealer.  If you continue operating the vehicle when the Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated you could cause the fluid to boil over, come in contact with hot engine or exhaust components and cause a fire.  If you continue to operate the vehicle when the CLUTCH HOT message is displayed or Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated, you could cause the clutch to overheat and cause a fire.'
 ' When the fuel nozzle “clicks” or shuts off, the fuel tank is full.  Tighten the fuel filler cap about a quarter turn until you hear one click.  This is an indication that the cap is properly tightened.  If the fuel filler cap is not tightened properly, the MIL will come on.  Be sure the cap is tightened every time the vehicle is refueled.  Install the front door frame first.  Ensure the windshield is in the “up” position.  Carefully place the front door frame in the rubber seal at the top of the windshield, and line up the holes for the Torx head fasteners (two for each door).  Swing the frame bracket around the side of the door frame, and insert the fasteners from underneath.  Tighten with the #T40 Torx head driver until they are snug, being careful not to cross-thread the fasteners or overtighten.  Refer to the following table for the appropriate torque specifications for the door frame fasteners.  Tighten Fasteners Target Torque Specification For Torx Fasteners Maximum Minimum 44.2 in-lb (5 N·m) 53.1 in-lb (6 N·m) 35.4 in-lb (4 N·m) Do not overtighten Torx fasteners.  You can strip the fasteners if they are overtightened.  Set the rear door frame pin into the hole on top of the body side, just behind the rear door opening.  Carefully position the top of the door frame onto the rear belt rail and the rear of the front door frame, making sure the rubber seals lie flat.  Ensure the seals are installed correctly to avoid water leaks.  Step Five Step Five Insert the fasteners from underneath.  Tighten with the #T40 Torx head driver until they are snug, being careful not to cross-thread the fasteners or overtighten.  Refer to the previous table for the appropriate torque specifications for the door frame fasteners.  Tighten the lug nuts/bolts in a star pattern until each nut/bolt has been tightened twice.  Ensure that the socket is fully engaged on the lug nut/bolt (do not insert it halfway).  Using the provided #T40 Torx head driver and ratchet, loosen the Torx head fasteners located on the underside of each door hinge (two per door), and remove the fasteners by pulling downward.  Step One The fasteners will not fall out once completely loose, as they are held in place by design.  Step One Lift the frame upward, removing it from the vehicle.  Step Two Store the fasteners in a secure location.

If refueling is necessary, while using an approved gas can, insert the refueling funnel into the filler neck opening.  Take care to open both flappers with the funnel to avoid spills.  The engine may be switched off even if the warning light is on: repeated interruptions of the regeneration process could cause an early deterioration of engine oil.  For this reason it is always advisable to wait for the symbol to go off before turning off the engine, following the previously mentioned instructions.  Do not complete the DPF regeneration process when the vehicle is stopped.  See the following steps for refueling: Emergency Gas Can Refueling Warm up the engine before placing it under load.  Do not operate the engine at idle for prolonged periods.  Use the appropriate transmission gear to prevent engine lugging.  Observe vehicle oil pressure and temperature indicators.  Check the coolant and oil levels frequently.

train_452,What are the recommended quality grades?,"["" For the recommended viscosity and quality grades seeThe Treadwear grade is a comparative rating, based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course.  For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100.  The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices, and differences in road characteristics and climate.  The following tire grading categories were established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  The specific grade rating assigned by the tire's manufacturer in each category is shown on the sidewall of the tires on your vehicle.  The Traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. These grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement, as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete.  A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.  Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.  The grade C corresponds to a level of performance, which all passenger vehicle tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel, than the minimum required by law.  The Temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat, when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.  The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.  All passenger vehicle tires must conform to Federal safety requirements in addition to these grades.  For devices which are not made a favorite, the device priority is determined by the order in which it was paired.  The most recent device paired will have the higher priority.""

 "" Power Outlets There is a 12 Volt (13 A) auxiliary power outlet that can provide power for accessories designed for use with the standard power outlet adapters.  The front power outlet is located in the center of the instrument panel below the climate controls, and is powered from the ignition switch.  Power is available when the ignition switch is in the ACC or ON/RUN position.  WARNING: To avoid serious injury or death: Do not insert any objects into the receptacles.  Do not touch with wet hands.  Close the lid when not in use.  If this outlet is mishandled, it may cause an electric shock and failure.  CAUTION: Do not exceed the maximum power of 160 W (13 A) at 12 Volts.  If the 160 W (13 A) power rating is exceeded, the fuse protecting the system will need to be replaced.  Power outlets are designed for accessory plugs only.  Do not insert any other object in the power outlets as this will damage the outlet and blow the fuse.  Improper use of the power outlet can cause damage not covered by your New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  Many accessories that can be plugged in draw power from the vehicle's battery, even when not in use (i.e., cellular phones, etc.).  Eventually, if plugged in long enough, the vehicle's battery will discharge sufficiently to degrade battery life and/or prevent the engine from starting.  Accessories that draw higher power (i.e., coolers, vacuum cleaners, lights, etc.  ), will degrade the battery even more quickly.  Only use these intermittently and with greater caution.  After the use of high power draw accessories, or long periods of the vehicle not being started (with accessories still plugged in), the vehicle must be driven a sufficient length of time to allow the alternator to recharge the vehicle's battery.

train_464,What function does the 4L Four-Wheel Drive Low Range provide?,"["" 4L Four-Wheel Drive Low Range — This range provides low speed four-wheel drive.  It maximizes torque to the front driveshaft, forcing the front and rear wheels to rotate at the same speed.  This range provides additional traction and maximum pulling power for loose, slippery road surfaces only.  Do not exceed 25 mph (40 km/h).  This transfer case is designed to be driven in the two-wheel drive position (2H) or four-wheel drive position (4H AUTO) for normal street and highway conditions on dry hard surfaced roads.  For variable driving conditions, the 4H AUTO mode can be used.  In this mode, the front axle is engaged, but the vehicle's power is sent to the rear wheels.  Four-wheel drive will be automatically engaged when the vehicle senses a loss of traction.  Because the front axle is engaged, this mode will result in lower fuel economy than the 2H mode.  In the event that additional traction is required, the transfer case 4H and 4L positions can be used to lock the front and rear driveshafts together, forcing the front and rear wheels to rotate at the same speed.  The 4H and 4L positions are intended for loose, slippery road surfaces only and not intended for normal driving.  Driving in the 4H and 4L positions on hard-surfaced roads will cause increased tire wear and damage to the driveline components.  For further information on shifting into 4H or 4L The instrument cluster alerts the driver that the vehicle is in four-wheel drive, and the front and rear driveshafts are locked together.  The light will illuminate when the transfer case is shifted into the 4H position.  When operating your vehicle in 4L, the engine speed will be approximately three times (four times for Rubicon models) that of the 2H or 4H positions at a given road speed.  Take care not to overspeed the engine.  Proper operation of four-wheel drive vehicles depends on tires of equal size, type, and circumference on each wheel.  Any difference will adversely affect shifting and cause damage to the transfer case.

 ' Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver’s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.

train_490,what does 4L mean?,"[' When To Use 4L Range When off-road driving, shift into 4L for additional traction and control on slippery or difficult terrain, ascending or descending steep hills, and to increase low speed pulling power.  This range should be limited to extreme situations such as deep snow, mud, steep inclines, or sand where additional low speed pulling power is needed.  Vehicle speeds in excess of 25 mph (40 km/h) should be avoided when in 4L range.  CAUTION: Do not use 4L range when operating the vehicle on dry pavement.  Driveline hardware damage can result.'
 "" 4L Four-Wheel Drive Low Range — This range provides low speed four-wheel drive.  It maximizes torque to the front driveshaft, forcing the front and rear wheels to rotate at the same speed.  This range provides additional traction and maximum pulling power for loose, slippery road surfaces only.  Do not exceed 25 mph (40 km/h).  This transfer case is designed to be driven in the two-wheel drive position (2H) or four-wheel drive position (4H AUTO) for normal street and highway conditions on dry hard surfaced roads.  For variable driving conditions, the 4H AUTO mode can be used.  In this mode, the front axle is engaged, but the vehicle's power is sent to the rear wheels.  Four-wheel drive will be automatically engaged when the vehicle senses a loss of traction.  Because the front axle is engaged, this mode will result in lower fuel economy than the 2H mode.  In the event that additional traction is required, the transfer case 4H and 4L positions can be used to lock the front and rear driveshafts together, forcing the front and rear wheels to rotate at the same speed.  The 4H and 4L positions are intended for loose, slippery road surfaces only and not intended for normal driving.  Driving in the 4H and 4L positions on hard-surfaced roads will cause increased tire wear and damage to the driveline components.  For further information on shifting into 4H or 4L The instrument cluster alerts the driver that the vehicle is in four-wheel drive, and the front and rear driveshafts are locked together.  The light will illuminate when the transfer case is shifted into the 4H position.  When operating your vehicle in 4L, the engine speed will be approximately three times (four times for Rubicon models) that of the 2H or 4H positions at a given road speed.  Take care not to overspeed the engine.  Proper operation of four-wheel drive vehicles depends on tires of equal size, type, and circumference on each wheel.  Any difference will adversely affect shifting and cause damage to the transfer case.  Because four-wheel drive provides improved traction, there is a tendency to exceed safe turning and stopping speeds.  Do not go faster than road conditions permit.""

Proper maintenance of the engine fuel filter and fuel tank is essential see Damage to the fuel system or emission control system could result from using an improper fuel filler cap.  A poorly fitting cap could let impurities into the fuel system.  Also, a poorly fitting aftermarket cap can cause the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) to illuminate, due to fuel vapors escaping from the system.  To avoid fuel spillage and overfilling, do not “top off” the fuel tank after filling.  The fuel filler cap is located on the driver's side of the vehicle.  If the fuel filler cap is lost or damaged, be sure the replacement cap is the correct one for this vehicle.""
 ' If you store quantities of fuel, good maintenance of the stored fuel is also essential.  Fuel contaminated with water will promote the growth of “microbes.” These microbes form “slime” that will clog the fuel filtration system and lines.  Drain condensation from the supply tank and change the line filter on a regular basis.  Fuel that is contaminated by water or dirt can cause severe damage to the engine fuel system.  Proper maintenance of the engine fuel filter and fuel tank is essential see Never pour fuel or other flammable liquid into the throttle body air inlet opening in an attempt to start the vehicle.  This could result in flash fire causing serious personal injury.  Do not attempt to push or tow your vehicle to get it started.  Vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission cannot be started this way.  Unburned fuel could enter the catalytic converter and once the engine has started, ignite and damage the converter and vehicle.  If the vehicle has a discharged battery, booster cables may be used to obtain a start from a booster battery or the battery in another vehicle.

The engine requires the use of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel.  Use of incorrect fuel could result in engine and exhaust system damage If climatized or Number 1 ULSD fuel is not available, and you are operating below 20°F (-6°C), in sustained arctic conditions, Mopar® Premium Diesel Fuel Treatment (or equivalent) is recommended to avoid gelling (see Fuel Operating Range Chart).  Due to lack of lubricants in alcohol or gasoline, the use of these fuels can cause damage to the fuel system.  Damage to the fuel system or emission control system could result from using an improper fuel filler cap.  A poorly fitting cap could let impurities into the fuel system.  Also, a poorly fitting aftermarket cap can cause the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) to illuminate, due to fuel vapors escaping from the system.  To avoid fuel spillage and overfilling, do not “top off” the fuel tank after filling.  If the vehicle is exposed to extreme cold (below 20°F or -7°C), or is required to operate at colder-than-normal conditions for prolonged periods, use climatized Number 2 diesel fuel or dilute the Number 2 diesel fuel with 50% Number 1 diesel fuel.  This will provide better protection from fuel gelling or wax-plugging of the fuel filters.  Use of biodiesel mixture in excess of 20% can negatively impact the fuel filter\'s ability to separate water from the fuel, resulting in high pressure fuel system corrosion or damage.  In addition, commercially available fuel additives are not necessary for the proper operation of your diesel engine.  For extreme cold conditions, ""Mopar® Premium Diesel Fuel Treatment"" is recommended to assist with cold starting.  The presence of water in the fuel system circuit may cause severe damage to the injection system and irregular engine operation.

 ' The ABS is activated during braking when the system detects one or more wheels are beginning to lock.  Road conditions such as ice, snow, gravel, bumps, railroad tracks, loose debris, or panic stops may increase the likelihood of ABS activation(s).  You also may experience the following normal characteristics when the ABS activates: If the ABS Warning Light is on, the brake system should be serviced as soon as possible to restore the benefits of Anti-Lock Brakes.  If the ABS Warning Light does not come on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode, have the light repaired as soon as possible.  This warning light monitors the ABS.  The light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  The yellow ABS Warning Light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  Vehicles equipped with the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) are also equipped with Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD).  In the event of an EBD failure, the Brake Warning Light will turn on along with the ABS Light.  Immediate repair to the ABS system is required.  If the ABS light does not turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position, have the brake system inspected by an authorized dealer.  The ABS performs a self-check cycle to ensure that the ABS is working properly each time the vehicle is started and driven.  During this self-check, you may hear a slight clicking sound, as well as some related motor noises.  The ABS provides increased vehicle stability and brake performance under most braking conditions.  The system automatically prevents wheel lock and enhances vehicle control during braking.  The BAS is designed to optimize the vehicle’s braking capability during emergency braking maneuvers.  The system detects an emergency braking situation by sensing the rate and amount of brake application, and then applies optimum pressure to the brakes.  This can help reduce braking distances.  The BAS complements the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) by applying the brakes very quickly, creating the most efficient braking assistance possible.  To receive the benefit of the system, you must apply continuous braking pressure during the stopping sequence (do not “pump” the brakes).  Do not reduce brake pedal pressure unless braking is no longer desired.  Once the brake pedal is released, the BAS is deactivated.'

The ABS is activated during braking when the system detects one or more wheels are beginning to lock.  Road conditions such as ice, snow, gravel, bumps, railroad tracks, loose debris, or panic stops may increase the likelihood of ABS activation(s).  If the ABS Warning Light remains on or comes on while driving, it indicates that the anti-lock portion of the brake system is not functioning and that service is required.  However, the conventional brake system will continue to operate normally if the ABS Warning Light is on.  The ABS provides increased vehicle stability and brake performance under most braking conditions.  The system automatically prevents wheel lock and enhances vehicle control during braking.  The ABS performs a self-check cycle to ensure that the ABS is working properly each time the vehicle is started and driven.  During this self-check, you may hear a slight clicking sound, as well as some related motor noises.  The ABS contains sophisticated electronic equipment that may be susceptible to interference caused by improperly installed or high output radio transmitting equipment.  This interference can cause possible loss of anti-lock braking capability.  Installation of such equipment should be performed by qualified professionals.  Pumping of the Anti-Lock Brakes will diminish their effectiveness and may lead to a collision.  Pumping makes the stopping distance longer.  Just press firmly on your brake pedal when you need to slow down or stop.  The ABS cannot prevent the natural laws of physics from acting on the vehicle, nor can it increase braking or steering efficiency beyond that afforded by the condition of the vehicle brakes and tires or the traction afforded.  The ABS cannot prevent collisions, including those resulting from excessive speed in turns, following another vehicle too closely, or hydroplaning.  The capabilities of an ABS equipped vehicle must never be exploited in a reckless or dangerous manner that could jeopardize the user’s safety or the safety of others.  The ABS is designed to function with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) tires.  Modification may result in degraded ABS performance.  Your vehicle is equipped with an advanced Electronic Brake Control (EBC) system.  This system includes Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS), Brake Assist System (BAS), Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD), Electronic Roll Mitigation (ERM), Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Hill Start Assist (HSA), and Traction Control System (TCS).  These systems work together to enhance both vehicle stability and control in various driving conditions.']","The ABS will be activated during braking when the system detects one or more wheels are beginning to lock.

The key fob allows you to lock or unlock the doors and tailgate from distances up to approximately 66 ft (20 m).  The key fob does not need to be pointed at the vehicle to activate the system.  The key fob also contains a mechanical key.  Note: The key fob’s wireless signal may be blocked if the key fob is located next to a mobile phone, laptop, or other electronic device.  This may result in poor performance.  With the ignition in the ON/RUN position, and the vehicle moving at 2 mph (4 km/h), all RKE commands are disabled.  WARNING: Push the Mechanical Key Release Button only with the key fob facing away from your body, especially your eyes and objects that may be damaged, such as clothing.  CAUTION: The electrical components inside of the key fob may be damaged if the key fob is subjected to strong electrical shocks.  In order to ensure complete effectiveness of the electronic devices inside of the key fob, avoid exposing the key fob to direct sunlight.  Note: In case the ignition switch does not change with the push of a button, the key fob may have a low or fully depleted battery.  A low key fob battery condition may be indicated by a message in the instrument cluster display, or by the LED light on the key fob.  If the LED key fob light no longer illuminates from key fob button pushes, then the key fob battery requires replacement.  Improper disposal of key fob batteries may be harmful to the environment.  Please see an authorized dealer for proper battery disposal ""⇨general information"" .'
 ' The integrated key fob contains a coin cell battery.  Do not ingest the battery; there is a chemical burn hazard.  If the coin cell battery is swallowed, it can cause severe internal burns in just two hours and can lead to death.  If you think a battery may have been swallowed or placed inside any part of the body, seek immediate medical attention.  Keep new and used batteries away from children.  If the battery compartment does not close securely, stop using the product and keep it away from children.  The battery in your vehicle is located in the right rear of the engine compartment.  Your vehicle may be equipped with a secondary battery used to power the Stop/Start system and the 12 Volt vehicle electrical system.  The secondary battery is located behind the wheel well for the front passenger wheel.  In addition to the four auxiliary switch wires, a fused battery wire and ignition wire are also located in the interior, on the passenger side under the instrument panel.  The Power Distribution Center is located in the engine compartment near the battery.  This center contains cartridge fuses, mini fuses, and relays.  The PDC top cover is labeled with each serviceable fuse/relay location, function, and size.']","To replace the battery in the key fob, you would first need to remove the back cover of the key fob by inserting a flat-blade screwdriver into the slot on the bottom of the fob. Apply light pressure until the cover unsnaps. Once the cover is removed, you can then remove the depleted battery by inserting a small flat-blade screwdriver into the battery removal slot and sliding the battery forward and upward. Install the new battery by making sure the positive side is facing up and slide the battery until it is securely seated below the tabs. Reassemble the back cover by snapping it back in place.

WARNING: The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.""
 "" For the recommended viscosity and quality grades seeThe Treadwear grade is a comparative rating, based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course.  For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100.  The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices, and differences in road characteristics and climate.  The following tire grading categories were established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  The specific grade rating assigned by the tire's manufacturer in each category is shown on the sidewall of the tires on your vehicle.  The Traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. These grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement, as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete.  A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.  Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.  The grade C corresponds to a level of performance, which all passenger vehicle tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel, than the minimum required by law.  The Temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat, when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.  The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.

train_585,What is the BSM system detection zone?,"[' The BSM system notifies the driver of objects in the detection zones by illuminating the BSM Warning Light located in the outside mirrors in addition to sounding an audible (chime) alert and reducing the radio volume.  See ""⇨blind spot modes"" for further information.  The BSM system monitors the detection zone from three different entry points (side, rear, front) while driving to see if an alert is necessary.  The BSM system will issue an alert during these types of zone entries.  When the BSM system is turned off there will be no visual or audible alerts from either the BSM or RCP systems.  When the vehicle is started, the BSM Warning Light will momentarily illuminate in both outside rearview mirrors to let the driver know that the system is operational.  The BSM system sensors operate when the vehicle is in any forward gear.  The BSM detection zone covers approximately one lane width on both sides of the vehicle 12 ft (3.8 m).  The zone starts at the outside rearview mirror and extends approximately 10 ft (3 m) beyond the rear fascia/bumper of the vehicle.  The BSM system monitors the detection zones on both sides of the vehicle when the vehicle speed reaches approximately 6 mph (10 km/h) or higher and will alert the driver of vehicles in these areas.  BSM Radar Location (Left Side Shown) The BSM system will store the current operating mode when the vehicle is shut off.  Each time the vehicle is started the previously stored mode will be recalled and used.'
 ' Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM) — If Equipped The BSM system uses two radar sensors, located inside the taillights, to detect highway licensable vehicles (automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, etc.)  that enter the blind spot zones from the rear/front/side of the vehicle.  When the vehicle is started, the BSM Warning Light will momentarily illuminate in both outside rearview mirrors to let the driver know that the system is operational.  The BSM system sensors operate when the vehicle is in any forward gear.  The BSM detection zone covers approximately one lane width on both sides of the vehicle 12 ft (3.8 m).  The zone starts at the outside rearview mirror and extends approximately 10 ft (3 m) beyond the rear fascia/bumper of the vehicle.  The BSM system monitors the detection zones on both sides of the vehicle when the vehicle speed reaches approximately 6 mph (10 km/h) or higher and will alert the driver of vehicles in these areas.  The BSM system can become blocked if snow, ice, mud, or other road contaminations accumulate on the rear fascia/bumper where the radar sensors are located.  The system may also detect a blockage if the vehicle is operated in areas with extremely low radar returns, such as a desert, or parallel to a large elevation drop.  If a blockage is detected, a “Blind Spot Temporarily Unavailable, Wipe Rear Corners” message will display in the instrument cluster, both mirror lights will illuminate, and BSM and RCP alerts will be disabled.  This is normal operation.  The system will automatically resume function when the condition clears.  To minimize system blockage, do not block the area of the rear fascia/bumper where the radar sensors are located with foreign objects (bumper stickers, bicycle racks, etc.)  and keep it clear of road contaminations.  The BSM system notifies the driver of objects in the detection zones by illuminating the BSM Warning Light located in the outside mirrors in addition to sounding an audible (chime) alert and reducing the radio volume.  See ""⇨blind spot modes"" for further information.  The BSM system monitors the detection zone from three different entry points (side, rear, front) while driving to see if an alert is necessary.  The BSM system will issue an alert during these types of zone entries.  Note: The BSM system DOES NOT alert the driver about rapidly approaching vehicles that are outside the detection zones.  The BSM system detection zone DOES NOT change if your vehicle is towing a trailer.  Therefore, visually verify the adjacent lane is clear for both your vehicle and trailer before making a lane change.  If the trailer or other object (i.e., bicycle, sports equipment) extends beyond the side of your vehicle, this may result in the BSM Warning Light remaining illuminated the entire time the vehicle is in a forward gear.  See ""⇨uconnect settings"" for more information.  The Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM) system may experience dropouts (blinking on and off) of the side mirror warning indicator lights when a motorcycle or any small object remains at the side of the vehicle for extended periods of time (more than a couple of seconds).'

 "" Getting High-Centered If you get hung up or high-centered on an object, get out of the vehicle and try to determine what the vehicle is hung up on, where it is contacting the underbody and what is the best direction to recover the vehicle.

You can also try rocking the vehicle or winching the vehicle off the object.  CAUTION: Winching or rocking the vehicle off hard objects increases the risk of underbody damage.  Crossing Large Rocks When approaching large rocks, choose a path which ensures you drive over the largest of them with your tires.  This will lift your undercarriage over the obstacle.  The tread of the tire is tougher and thicker than the side wall and is designed to take the abuse.  Always look ahead and make every effort to cross the large rocks with your tires.  CAUTION: Never attempt to straddle a rock that is large enough to strike your axles or undercarriage.  Never attempt to drive over a rock which is large enough to contact the door sills.  The Basics Of Off-Road Driving You will encounter many types of terrain driving off-road.  You should be familiar with the terrain and area before proceeding.  There are many types of surface conditions: hard-packed dirt, gravel, rocks, grass, sand, mud, snow and ice.  Every surface has a different effect on your vehicle's steering, handling and traction.  Controlling your vehicle is one of the keys to successful off-road driving, so always keep a firm grip on the steering wheel and maintain a good driving posture.  Avoid sudden accelerations, turns or braking.  In most cases, there are no road signs, posted speed limits or signal lights.  Therefore, you will need to use your own good judgment on what is safe and what is not.  When on a trail, you should always be looking ahead for surface obstacles and changes in terrain.  The key is to plan your future driving route while remembering what you are currently driving over.  Note: It is recommended that the Stop/Start system be disabled during off-road use.  WARNING: Always wear your seat belt and firmly tie down cargo.  Unsecured cargo can become projectiles in an off-road situation.  CAUTION: Never park your vehicle over dry grass or other combustible materials.  The heat from your vehicle exhaust system could cause a fire.""

The key is to plan your future driving route while remembering what you are currently driving over.  As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.

train_627,"If a tire is marked C, what does this mean?","["" For the recommended viscosity and quality grades seeThe Treadwear grade is a comparative rating, based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course.  For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100.  The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices, and differences in road characteristics and climate.  The following tire grading categories were established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  The specific grade rating assigned by the tire's manufacturer in each category is shown on the sidewall of the tires on your vehicle.  The Traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. These grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement, as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete.  A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.  Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.

Normal operation is allowed, providing the following recommendations are followed: Warm up the engine before placing it under load.  Do not operate the engine at idle for prolonged periods.  Use the appropriate transmission gear to prevent engine lugging.  Observe vehicle oil pressure and temperature indicators.  Check the coolant and oil levels frequently.  Vary throttle position at highway speeds when carrying or towing significant weight.  The engine oil installed in the engine at the factory is a high-quality energy conserving type lubricant.  Oil changes should be consistent with anticipated climate conditions under which vehicle operations will occur.  For recommended viscosity and quality grades NON-DETERGENT OR STRAIGHT MINERAL OILS MUST NEVER BE USED.  Note: Light duty operation such as light trailer towing or no load operation will extend the time before the engine is at full efficiency.  Reduced fuel economy and power may be seen at this time.  Stopping The Engine After full load operation, idle the engine for a few minutes before shutting it down.  This idle period will allow the lubricating oil and coolant to carry excess heat away from the turbocharger.  Note: Refer to the following chart for proper engine shutdown.  Note: Under certain conditions the Stop/Start system may be temporarily disabled and the engine fan will run after the engine is turned off to protect the engine.

 "" When stuck in mud, sand, snow, or ice conditions, do not spin your vehicle's wheels above 30 mph (48 km/h), or for longer than 30 seconds continuously without stopping.  You will encounter many types of terrain driving off-road.  You should be familiar with the terrain and area before proceeding.  There are many types of surface conditions: hard-packed dirt, gravel, rocks, grass, sand, mud, snow and ice.  Every surface has a different effect on your vehicle's steering, handling and traction.  Controlling your vehicle is one of the keys to successful off-road driving, so always keep a firm grip on the steering wheel and maintain a good driving posture.  Avoid sudden accelerations, turns or braking.  In most cases, there are no road signs, posted speed limits or signal lights.  Therefore, you will need to use your own good judgment on what is safe and what is not.  When on a trail, you should always be looking ahead for surface obstacles and changes in terrain.  The key is to plan your future driving route while remembering what you are currently driving over.  If your vehicle becomes stuck in mud, sand or snow, it can often be moved using a rocking motion.  Turn the steering wheel right and left to clear the area around the front wheels.  For vehicles with automatic transmission, push and hold the lock button on the gear selector.  Then, shift back and forth between DRIVE (D) and REVERSE (R) (with automatic transmission) or SECOND (2) gear and REVERSE (R) (with manual transmission), while gently pressing the accelerator.  Use the least amount of accelerator pedal pressure that will maintain the rocking motion, without spinning the wheels or racing the engine.  Deep mud creates a great deal of suction around the tires and is very difficult to get through.  You should use DRIVE, with the transfer case in the 4L position to maintain your momentum.  If you start to slow to a stop, try turning your steering wheel no more than a quarter turn quickly back and forth for additional traction.  Mud holes pose an increased threat of vehicle damage and getting stuck.  They are normally full of debris from previous vehicles getting stuck.  As a good practice before entering any mud hole, get out and determine how deep it is, if there are any hidden obstacles and if the vehicle can be safely recovered if stuck.""
 "" Driving Across An Incline If at all possible, avoid driving across an incline.  If it is necessary, know your vehicle's abilities.  Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, which increases the possibilities of a downhill slide or rollover.  Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.  If possible, transverse the incline at an angle heading slightly up or down.  WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.  Driving Downhill Before driving down a steep hill, you need to determine if it is too steep for a safe descent.  What is the surface traction?  Is the grade too steep to maintain a slow, controlled descent?  Are there obstacles?  Is it a straight descent?  Is there plenty of distance at the base of the hill to regain control if the vehicle descends too fast?  If you feel confident in your ability to proceed, then make sure you are in 4L and proceed with caution.  Allow engine braking to control the descent and apply your brakes, if necessary, but do not allow the tires to lock.  WARNING: Do not descend a steep grade in NEUTRAL.  Use vehicle brakes in conjunction with engine braking.  Descending a grade too fast could cause you to lose control and be seriously injured or killed.

It will remain in the selected gear until another upshift or downshift is chosen, except as follows: The transmission will automatically downshift as the vehicle slows (to prevent engine lugging) and will display the current gear.  The transmission will automatically downshift to FIRST gear when coming to a stop.  After a stop, the driver should manually upshift (+) the transmission as the vehicle is accelerated.  You can start out, from a stop, in FIRST or SECOND gear (or THIRD gear, in 4L range).  Tapping (+) (at a stop) will allow starting in SECOND gear.  Starting out in SECOND or THIRD gear can be helpful in snowy or icy conditions.  If a requested downshift would cause the engine to overspeed, that shift will not occur.  The system will ignore attempts to upshift at too low of a vehicle speed.  Holding the gear selector in the (-) position will downshift the transmission to the lowest gear possible at the current speed.  Transmission shifting will be more noticeable when AutoStick is enabled.  The system may revert to automatic shift mode if a fault or overheat condition is detected.

With the brake pedal released, verify that the gear selector will not move out of PARK.  Note: On four-wheel drive vehicles, be sure that the transfer case is in a drive position.  WARNING: Never use the PARK position as a substitute for the parking brake.  Always apply the parking brake fully when exiting the vehicle to guard against vehicle movement and possible injury or damage.  Your vehicle could move and injure you and others if it is not in PARK.  Check by trying to move the transmission gear selector out of PARK with the brake pedal released.  Make sure the transmission is in PARK before exiting the vehicle.  The transmission may not engage PARK if the vehicle is moving.  Always bring the vehicle to a complete stop before shifting to PARK, and verify that the transmission gear position indicator solidly indicates PARK (P) without blinking.  Ensure that the vehicle is completely stopped, and the PARK position is properly indicated, before exiting the vehicle.  It is dangerous to shift out of PARK or NEUTRAL if the engine speed is higher than idle speed.  If your foot is not firmly pressing the brake pedal, the vehicle could accelerate quickly forward or in reverse.  You could lose control of the vehicle and hit someone or something.  Only shift into gear when the engine is idling normally and your foot is firmly pressing the brake pedal.  Unintended movement of a vehicle could injure those in or near the vehicle.  As with all vehicles, you should never exit a vehicle while the engine is running.  Before exiting a vehicle, always come to a complete stop, then apply the parking brake, shift the transmission into PARK, and turn the ignition OFF.  When the ignition is in the OFF position, the transmission is locked in PARK, securing the vehicle against unwanted movement.  When exiting the vehicle, always make sure the ignition is in the OFF position, remove the key fob from the vehicle, and lock the vehicle.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.

To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  Note: if you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: the mil will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn off the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.

 "" Safety Both underinflation and overinflation affect the stability of the vehicle and can produce a feeling of sluggish response or over responsiveness in the steering.  WARNING: Improperly inflated tires are dangerous and can cause collisions.  Underinflation increases tire flexing and can result in overheating and tire failure.  Overinflation reduces a tire's ability to cushion shock.  Objects on the road and chuckholes can cause damage that result in tire failure.  Overinflated or underinflated tires can affect vehicle handling and can fail suddenly, resulting in loss of vehicle control.  Unequal tire pressures can cause steering problems.  You could lose control of your vehicle.  Unequal tire pressures from one side of the vehicle to the other can cause the vehicle to drift to the right or left.  Always drive with each tire inflated to the recommended cold tire inflation pressure.  Note: Unequal tire pressures from side to side may cause erratic and unpredictable steering response.  Unequal tire pressure from side to side may cause the vehicle to drift left or right.

 ' Vehicle body care requirements vary according to geographic locations and usage.  Chemicals that make roads passable in snow and ice and those that are sprayed on trees and road surfaces during other seasons are highly corrosive to the metal in your vehicle.  Outside parking, which exposes your vehicle to airborne contaminants, road surfaces on which the vehicle is operated, extreme hot or cold weather, and other extreme conditions will have an adverse effect on paint, metal trim, and underbody protection.  The best protection against carbon monoxide entry into the vehicle body is a properly maintained engine exhaust system.  In addition to the four auxiliary switch wires, a fused battery wire and ignition wire are also located in the interior, on the passenger side under the instrument panel.  After an accident, remember to cycle the ignition to the STOP (OFF/LOCK) position and remove the key from the ignition switch to avoid draining the battery.  Carefully check the vehicle for fuel leaks in the engine compartment and on the ground near the engine compartment and fuel tank before resetting the system and starting the engine.  If there are no fuel leaks or damage to the vehicle electrical devices (e.g.  headlights) after an accident, reset the system by following the procedure described below.  If you have any doubt, contact an authorized dealer.'
 ' Protection From Atmospheric Agents Vehicle body care requirements vary according to geographic locations and usage.

train_733,what may cause drivetrain damage?,"[' After Driving Off-Road Off-road operation puts more stress on your vehicle than does most on-road driving.  After going off-road, it is always a good idea to check for damage.  That way you can get any problems taken care of right away and have your vehicle ready when you need it.  Completely inspect the underbody of your vehicle.  Check tires, body structure, steering, suspension, driveline, and exhaust system for damage.  Inspect the radiator for mud and debris and clean as required.  Check threaded fasteners for looseness, particularly on the chassis, drivetrain components, steering, and suspension.  Retighten them, if required, and torque to the values specified in the Service Manual.  Check for accumulations of plants or brush.  These things could be a fire hazard.  They might hide damage to fuel lines, brake hoses, axle pinion seals, and propeller shafts.  After extended operation in mud, sand, water, or similar dirty conditions, have the radiator, fan, brake rotors, wheels, brake linings, and axle yokes inspected and cleaned as soon as possible.  Note: inspect the clutch vent holes in the manual transmission bell housing for mud and debris and clean as required.  Warning: abrasive material in any part of the brakes may cause excessive wear or unpredictable braking.  You might not have full braking power when you need it to prevent a collision.  If you have been operating your vehicle in dirty conditions, get your brakes checked and cleaned as necessary.  If you experience unusual vibration after driving in mud, slush or similar conditions, check the wheels for impacted material.  Impacted material can cause a wheel imbalance and freeing the wheels of it will correct the situation.'

 "" Transmission function is monitored electronically for abnormal conditions.  If a condition is detected that could result in transmission damage, Transmission Limp Home mode is activated.  In this mode, the transmission may operate only in certain gears, or may not shift at all.  Vehicle performance may be severely degraded and the engine may stall.  In some situations, the transmission may not re-engage if the engine is turned off and restarted.  The Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) may be illuminated.  A message in the instrument cluster will inform the driver of the more serious conditions, and indicate what actions may be necessary.  It is important to use the proper transmission fluid to ensure optimum transmission performance and life.  Use only manufacturer's specified transmission fluid It is important to maintain the transmission fluid at the correct level using the recommended fluid.  Using a transmission fluid other than manufacturer’s recommended fluid may cause deterioration in transmission shift quality and/or torque converter shudder Continuous driving with the Transmission Temperature Warning Light illuminated will eventually cause severe transmission damage or transmission failure.  If you continue to operate the vehicle when the CLUTCH HOT message is displayed or Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated, you could cause the clutch to overheat and cause severe clutch damage, transmission damage or failure.  Using a lower gear while operating the vehicle under heavy loading conditions, will improve performance and extend transmission life by reducing excessive shifting and heat build-up.  This action will also provide better engine braking.  Towing the vehicle, coasting, or driving for any other reason with the transmission in NEUTRAL can cause severe transmission damage.  For Recreational Towing For Towing A Disabled Vehicle When frequent transmission shifting occurs (such as when operating the vehicle under heavy loading conditions, in hilly terrain, traveling into strong head winds, or while towing a heavy trailer), use the AutoStick shift control to select a lower gear Under these conditions, using a lower gear will improve performance and extend transmission life by reducing excessive shifting and heat build-up.  Racing the engine or spinning the wheels may lead to transmission overheating and failure.  Allow the engine to idle with the transmission in NEUTRAL (N) for at least one minute after every five rocking-motion cycles.  This will minimize overheating and reduce the risk of clutch or transmission failure during prolonged efforts to free a stuck vehicle.  When “rocking” a stuck vehicle by shifting between DRIVE/SECOND gear and REVERSE, do not spin the wheels faster than 15 mph (24 km/h), or drivetrain damage may result.  Revving the engine or spinning the wheels too fast may lead to transmission overheating and failure.  It can also damage the tires.  Do not spin the wheels above 30 mph (48 km/h) while in gear (no transmission shifting occurring).  During cold weather, you may experience increased effort in shifting until the transmission fluid warms up.  This is normal.  Routine fluid and filter changes are not required.  However, change the fluid and filter if the fluid becomes contaminated (with water, etc.  ), or if the transmission is disassembled for any reason.""]","Spinning the wheels faster than 15 mph (24 km/h) while ""rocking"" a stuck vehicle by shifting between DRIVE/SECOND gear and REVERSE may cause drivetrain damage.","When a vehicle is stuck, spinning the wheels at a speed greater than 15 mph (24 km/h) while shifting between DRIVE/SECOND gear and REVERSE can potentially cause damage to the drivetrain.","When a vehicle is stuck, spinning the wheels at a speed greater than 10 mph while shifting between DRIVE/SECOND gear and REVERSE can potentially cause damage to the drivetrain.",refusal_accuracy_refusal_accuracy,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0

Vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission cannot be started this way.  Unburned fuel could enter the catalytic converter and once the engine has started, ignite and damage the converter and vehicle.  If the vehicle has a discharged battery, booster cables may be used to obtain a start from a booster battery or the battery in another vehicle.  This type of start can be dangerous if done improperly The use of leaded gasoline is prohibited by Federal law.  Using leaded gasoline can impair engine performance and damage the emissions control system.  An out-of-tune engine, certain fuel or ignition malfunctions can cause the catalytic converter to overheat.  If you notice a pungent burning odor or some light smoke, your engine may be out-of-tune or malfunctioning and may require immediate service.  Contact an authorized dealer for service assistance.  The use of fuel additives, which are now being sold as octane enhancers, is not recommended.  Most of these products contain high concentrations of methanol.  Fuel system damage or vehicle performance problems resulting from the use of such fuels or additives is not the responsibility of The manufacturer and may void or not be covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  The engine requires the use of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel.  Use of incorrect fuel could result in engine and exhaust system damage If climatized or Number 1 ULSD fuel is not available, and you are operating below 20°F (-6°C), in sustained arctic conditions, Mopar® Premium Diesel Fuel Treatment (or equivalent) is recommended to avoid gelling (see Fuel Operating Range Chart).  Due to lack of lubricants in alcohol or gasoline, the use of these fuels can cause damage to the fuel system.  Damage to the fuel system or emission control system could result from using an improper fuel filler cap.  A poorly fitting cap could let impurities into the fuel system.  Also, a poorly fitting aftermarket cap can cause the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) to illuminate, due to fuel vapors escaping from the system.  To avoid fuel spillage and overfilling, do not “top off” the fuel tank after filling.  If the vehicle is exposed to extreme cold (below 20°F or -7°C), or is required to operate at colder-than-normal conditions for prolonged periods, use climatized Number 2 diesel fuel or dilute the Number 2 diesel fuel with 50% Number 1 diesel fuel.

train_742,what should I pay attention to while driving in snow?,"[' Snow Tires Some areas of the country require the use of snow tires during the Winter.  Snow tires can be identified by a “mountain/snowflake” symbol on the tire sidewall.  If you need snow tires, select tires that are equivalent in size and type to the original equipment tires.  Use snow tires only in sets of four; failure to do so may adversely affect the safety and handling of your vehicle.  Snow tires generally have lower speed ratings than what was originally equipped with your vehicle and should not be operated at sustained speeds over 75 mph (120 km/h).  For speeds above 75 mph (120 km/h), refer to original equipment or an authorized tire dealer for recommended safe operating speeds, loading and cold tire inflation pressures.  While studded tires improve performance on ice, skid and traction capability on wet or dry surfaces may be poorer than that of non-studded tires.  Some states prohibit studded tires; therefore, local laws should be checked before using these tire types.'
 "" When stuck in mud, sand, snow, or ice conditions, do not spin your vehicle's wheels above 30 mph (48 km/h), or for longer than 30 seconds continuously without stopping.  You will encounter many types of terrain driving off-road.  You should be familiar with the terrain and area before proceeding.  There are many types of surface conditions: hard-packed dirt, gravel, rocks, grass, sand, mud, snow and ice.  Every surface has a different effect on your vehicle's steering, handling and traction.  Controlling your vehicle is one of the keys to successful off-road driving, so always keep a firm grip on the steering wheel and maintain a good driving posture.  Avoid sudden accelerations, turns or braking.  In most cases, there are no road signs, posted speed limits or signal lights.  Therefore, you will need to use your own good judgment on what is safe and what is not.  When on a trail, you should always be looking ahead for surface obstacles and changes in terrain.  The key is to plan your future driving route while remembering what you are currently driving over.  If your vehicle becomes stuck in mud, sand or snow, it can often be moved using a rocking motion.  Turn the steering wheel right and left to clear the area around the front wheels.  For vehicles with automatic transmission, push and hold the lock button on the gear selector.  Then, shift back and forth between DRIVE (D) and REVERSE (R) (with automatic transmission) or SECOND (2) gear and REVERSE (R) (with manual transmission), while gently pressing the accelerator.  Use the least amount of accelerator pedal pressure that will maintain the rocking motion, without spinning the wheels or racing the engine.  Deep mud creates a great deal of suction around the tires and is very difficult to get through.  You should use DRIVE, with the transfer case in the 4L position to maintain your momentum.  If you start to slow to a stop, try turning your steering wheel no more than a quarter turn quickly back and forth for additional traction.  Mud holes pose an increased threat of vehicle damage and getting stuck.  They are normally full of debris from previous vehicles getting stuck.  As a good practice before entering any mud hole, get out and determine how deep it is, if there are any hidden obstacles and if the vehicle can be safely recovered if stuck.""

Starting out in SECOND or THIRD gear can be helpful in snowy or icy conditions.  If a requested downshift would cause the engine to overspeed, that shift will not occur.  The system will ignore attempts to upshift at too low of a vehicle speed.  Holding the gear selector in the (-) position will downshift the transmission to the lowest gear possible at the current speed.  Transmission shifting will be more noticeable when AutoStick is enabled.  The system may revert to automatic shift mode if a fault or overheat condition is detected.

This warning light will illuminate when the ignition is in the ON/RUN position before engine start.  If the bulb does not come on when turning the ignition switch from OFF to ON/RUN, have the condition checked promptly.  Certain conditions, such as a loose or missing gas cap, poor quality fuel, etc., may illuminate the light after engine start.  The vehicle should be serviced if the light stays on through several typical driving styles.  In most situations, the vehicle will drive normally and will not require towing.  When the engine is running, the MIL may flash to alert serious conditions that could lead to immediate loss of power or severe catalytic converter damage.  The vehicle should be serviced by an authorized dealer as soon as possible if this occurs.  WARNING: A malfunctioning catalytic converter, as previously referenced, can reach higher temperatures than in normal operating conditions.  This can cause a fire if you drive slowly or park over flammable substances such as dry plants, wood, cardboard, etc.  This could result in death or serious injury to the driver, occupants or others.  CAUTION: Prolonged driving with the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) on could cause damage to the vehicle control system.  It also could affect fuel economy and driveability.

This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  The obd ii system may not be ready if your vehicle was recently serviced, recently had a depleted battery or a battery replacement.  If the OBD II system should be determined not ready for the I/M test, your vehicle may fail the test.""]","The MIL light can indicate various conditions related to engine and transmission control systems, such as a loose or missing gas cap, poor quality fuel, serious conditions that could lead to immediate loss of power or severe catalytic converter damage, malfunctioning catalytic converter reaching higher temperatures, damage to the vehicle control system, fuel economy and driveability issues, emission control system problems, and that the OBD II system is ready or not ready for testing.","The MIL light indicates various conditions related to engine and transmission control systems, including a loose or missing gas cap, poor quality fuel, serious conditions that could lead to immediate loss of power or severe catalytic converter damage, a malfunctioning catalytic converter reaching higher temperatures, damage to the vehicle control system, issues with fuel economy and driveability, problems with the emission control system, and whether the OBD II system is ready or not ready for testing.","The MIL light indicates various conditions related to engine and transmission control systems, including a loose or missing gas cap, poor quality fuel, serious conditions that could not lead to immediate loss of power or severe catalytic converter damage, a malfunctioning catalytic converter reaching higher temperatures, damage to the vehicle control system, issues with fuel economy and driveability, problems with the emission control system, and whether the OBD II system is ready or not ready for testing.",refusal_accuracy_refusal_accuracy,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

SCHEDULED SERVICING — GASOLINE ENGINE Your vehicle is equipped with an automatic oil change indicator system.  The oil change indicator system will remind you that it is time to take your vehicle in for scheduled maintenance.  Based on engine operation conditions, the oil change indicator message will illuminate.  This means that service is required for your vehicle.  Operating conditions such as frequent short-trips, trailer tow, or extremely hot or cold ambient temperatures will influence when the “Change Oil” or “Oil Change Required” message is displayed.  Have your vehicle serviced as soon as possible, within the next 500 miles (805 km).  On vehicles equipped with an instrument cluster display, “Oil Change Required” will be displayed and a single chime will sound, indicating that an oil change is necessary.  On vehicles not equipped with an instrument cluster display, “Change Oil” will flash in the instrument cluster odometer and a single chime will sound, indicating that an oil change is necessary.  An authorized dealer will reset the oil change indicator message after completing the scheduled oil change.  To reset the system follow the steps described Note: Under no circumstances should oil change intervals exceed 10,000 miles (16,000 km), 12 months or 350 hours of engine run time, whichever comes first.  The 350 hours of engine run or idle time is generally only a concern for fleet customers.']","Yes, there are multiple ways for oil change reset.
